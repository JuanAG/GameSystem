BEGIN
	des := '<i>Fallout: New Vegas</i>, like its predecessors, takes place in an alternate timeline where a war over resources sprouts up in the 1950s and ultimately culminates in a nuclear apocalypse.  The game is set in the wastes of Nevada, surrounding the city of New Vegas, the successor of the old Las Vegas, a gambling paradise seemingly untouched by nuclear devastation. A war is brewing in this territory between the NCR (New California Republic) and various tribes of raiders, including the Great Khans and Caesar''s Legionnaires. The NCR is a group that wishes to preserve ancient weaponry as well as bring law and order to the wastes, no matter at what price.<br><br>The player takes on the role of a courier who is assigned to deliver a package to the mysterious and enigmatic Mr. House, the owner of New Vegas. However, once the package finds its way to its destination, a man in a checkered shirt and a pair of thugs intercept the courier and begin to dig an open grave. The courier is shot, buried, and left for dead, but is later dug up and brought to a doctor in a nearby town by a robot who saw the events transpire. The protagonist must now find out who tried to kill him/her, and why.<br><br>Gameplay primarily resembles its immediate predecessor, Fallout 3, utilizing the same engine, interface, and most features. Like the previous game, <i>Fallout: New Vegas</i> is open-ended and focuses on exploration. Although each game begins essentially the same, once the player has molded the protagonist''s base stats, traits, sex, and appearance, the game progresses in a largely non-linear fashion.  The player can pursue the main quest, or explore the wastes and take up side-quests from various NPCs.  The main character will level up as he or she gains experience by completing quests, doing unique actions and defeating foes.  <br><br>There are new gameplay elements as well. There is a larger variety of weaponry, and the player can now aim down the sights with guns, as well as change the type of ammo the gun uses.  Different types of ammo have different effects on enemies.  The player can also use workbenches, campfires, and reload benches to craft unique items, consumables, and ammunition respectively. There is an influence system in the protagonist''s standing with various towns and factions.  The influence rating will determine whether or not that faction or town is friendly to the protagonist or not, and his affiliation to some groups may affect this as well. The player can also try and fool enemy factions by dressing up as a member of that faction, but must use stealth to avoid guards as guards may see past the disguise.<br><br>There is also a new mode of play known as "Hardcore" mode.  Hardcore mode is an extreme difficulty setting that alters the gameplay to make a much larger focus on survival.  The changes in hardcore mode are as follows:<ul><li>Stimpaks will not heal the protagonist immediately, but over a period of time, and they cannot heal crippled limbs.  Only a doctor bag can heal a crippled limb.</li><li>Similarly, the RadAway chem does not remove radiation sickness immediately, but rather over a period of time.<li>The protagonist must eat food, drink water, and sleep on a regular basis, or he/she will die.<li>Ammo adds weight and encumbers the protagonist.<li>Companions can be killed in battle.</ul>As in <i>Fallout 3</i>, the protagonist levels up, gains perks (although perks now come every other level and instead of starting with a perk, the player starts with two special traits),  and can use functions such as fast traveling, waiting or sleeping to adjust the time of day, and fight foes in action combat using the traditional first-person control scheme (although the third-person camera is still an option), or the V.A.T.S. targeting system, which allows the player to pause the game and target specific parts of the enemy''s body.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows 7/Vista/XP<br/>Processor: Intel/AMD Dual Core CPU with 2 GHz or better<br/>RAM: 2 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 10 GB<br/>Video: NVIDIA GeForce 6 series, ATI 1300XT series or better<br/>Sound: DirectX compatible Sound Card';

	des := '<i>Diablo III</i> is the third instalment in Blizzard''s franchise. The plot is set twenty years after the events of Diablo II, when a star falls on the cathedral in Old Tristram (the same cathedral that the hero had to explore down to the depths of Hell in the original Diablo). The hero, one of five classes (Barbarian, Monk, Demon Hunter, Witch-doctor and Wizard), male or female, sets off to investigate the mysterious falling star.<br><br>The game, like its predecessors, is a dungeon crawler in which the player fights against hordes of enemies ranging from beasts and undead to actual demons. The environment is made of various maps. The towns and cities have predefined maps, and the fields and dungeons have randoms maps. These maps are reset any time the player reloads the game. The game has four acts, two game modes (normal and hardcore) as well as four difficulty levels: Normal, Nightmare, hell and Inferno. In hardcore mode, defeat is not allowed. The patches also added «monster power» setting, which allows to scale selected difficulty additionally from 1 to 10.<br><br>Each character have multiple sets of abilities to choose from: a standard (left click) attack, a special (right click) attack, four special abilities (key 1 to 4) and three passive abilities. For each class, each slot has a specific set of abilities that get unlocked by levelling-up. Some of these skills have a set of runes that adds a special effect to that same skill. Setting specific skills and runes is what will make your character unique.<br><br>Another important part of customization is the equipment. The equipment slots are: Head, shoulder, arm, chest, belt, legs, feet, main hand and off hand, as well as an amulet slot and two ring slots. The variety of random magic attributes of the equipment means switching armor pieces and weapons regularly. Further customization include dyes to color the armor pieces, and gems that can be put in socketed equipment to add more magic attributes. New equipment can be dropped by foes, bought in stores and auction houses or crafted in the forge. There is also a jewelry where one can make his own gems and amulets.<br><br>In solo mode, three different followers (Templar, Scoundrel and Enchantress) are eventually available to accompany the hero of his/her quest. They also have unique skills to choose and have six equipment slots (Rings and amulet, off hand and main hand, as well as a slot for a special tool, unique for each follower). A friend can also join a solo game at any time. The follower will become unavailable as the game switches to co-op mode. There is no friendly fire in multiplayer. There are also public games that the player can join instead of playing solo or co-op. A simple PVP mode is available too, called «duels», being free for all death match for up to 4 players.<br><br>A new addition to <i>Diablo III</i> is the auction house, where items are exchanged for in-game gold or real money, also usable to purchase Blizzard merchandise. The game features a wide array of achievements earned upon meeting certain requirements. Due to the random fields, dungeons and available sub-quests, it takes many play-through to get achievements, complete quests and find all of the game''s sub-plot and character''s back-story.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows® XP/Vista/7 (latest service packs) with DX 9.0c<br/>Processor: Intel Pentium® D 2.8 GHz or AMD Athlon 64 X2 4400+<br/>RAM: 1 GB RAM (XP), 1.5 GB (Vista/7)<br/>Hard Drive: 12 GB<br/>Video: NVIDIA® GeForce® 7800 GT or ATI Radeon X1950 Pro or better<br/>Sound: Yes';

So, Raynor retreats to his flagship, the battlecruiser Hyperion, and once again enters the fight for survival - and the search for his beloved Kerrigan.<br><br><i>StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty</i> is the first part in the <i>StarCraft II</i> trilogy. As such, most of the 29 missions of the single-player campaign have the player fight on the Terran side. There are, however, a few missions where the Protoss Zeratul gets to tell parts of his side of the story, with the player controlling him and his Protoss friends. Most of the missions feature different and changing objectives but are, at their core, all about real-time strategy, with the player more often than not having to build up his base from scratch, collect the two resources, produce and upgrade an army and fight the usual suspects: other Terrans, Zerg and Protoss. The gameplay is pretty straightforward RTS, using a rock-paper-scissors system in combat between the three very different races, with each unit vulnerable to several other units and vice versa.<br><br>As the campaign progresses, the player automatically gains access to new units, which he can then upgrade in the Armory of the Hyperion in exchange for money, also earned throughout the missions. Each unit and some of the buildings can be upgraded two times, unlocking new abilities for the unit. The stimpack for the Marines, for example, which allows them to do more damage for a short amount of time at the expense of some health.In addition, there''s the Laboratory on the Hyperion. Here, the scientists research Zerg and Protoss DNA, which the player collects during missions by fulfilling bonus objectives. These range from simply gathering samples from dead Zerg to killing a hulking Brutalisk. After each five tiers of the DNA double helix, the player can choose between two possible upgrades in each research tree, allowing him, for example, to either automate the collection of Vespine Gas or build two SCVs at once. Once both research trees have been completed, each additional DNA artifact is sold for a sum of credits.<br><br>The third deck on the Hyperion is the bridge. Here, the player chooses one from up to three missions as his next assignment, has the ability to replay both the in-game cutscenes and the rendered sequences and replay old missions, e.g. on a higher difficulty level to earn additional achievements or to discover the consequences of different choices as the branching plot unfolds.<br><br>The fourth deck is the Cantina. Here, the player can look at trophies earned for completing a story strand (e.g. all missions given by Tychus), watch the news, hire mercenaries (who will then become available in all upcoming missions in exchange for resources) or play a round of "The Lost Viking". The latter is a full-blown vertical-scrolling shooter like Raptor: Call of the Shadows, built with the included Starcraft Galaxy Editor and featuring many elements of the main game.<br><br><i>StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty</i> also offers an extensive multiplayer mode which differs greatly from the single-player experience. The player can play as any of the three races but the available units differ in part from the ones available to him in the campaign. The Terran Medic, for example, has been cut - only the flying Medivac can be built. Nine challenges are available to test the abilities of the player to e.g. know which units are best against others or how to survive the infamous Zerg rush.In addition, after entering the multiplayer, the player has to play several practice rounds during which the game judges his skill and throws him in one of the five leagues (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum and Diamond) and activates the match-making feature. Here, or in custom games, he can fight against up to eight players on 61 maps, some of which are specially made beginner''s versions of other maps to prevent early rushes. The maps are divided into several categories based on type of gameplay, like coop, simple free-for-all or team matches, and the amount of players; eight being the largest number of players a map can hold. Bots are available to fill up open slots and additional achievements are waiting to be earned in order to unlock new avatar pictures or troop banners.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows® 7/Windows® 8/Windows® 10 (latest Service Pack)<br/>Processor: Intel® Core 2 Duo o AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600+<br/>RAM: 2 GB RAM<br/>Hard Drive: 30 GB<br/>Video: NVIDIA® GeForce® 7600 GT or ATI Radeon HD 2600 XT or Intel® HD Graphics 3000 or high<br/>Sound: Yes (recommended)';

The Portal is only open to characters level 58 and higher.<br><br>Two new races enter the world of Azeroth in this expansion - the Blood Elves and the Draenei.  The Draenei are from Outland and having heard of the defeat of the Burning Legion by the forces on Azeroth, they have taken their ship, the Exodar, to Azeroth in search of help defeating the Legion in Outland.  However, the Blood Elves sabotaged their ship and they crashed onto Azeroth and must pick up the pieces and go out in search of more allies.  The Blood Elves, on the other hand, have come to do anything they can to stop the the Draenei and have little trust for either the Horde or Alliance.  They are rebuilding the elven capital in Quel''Thalas and have a thirst for both magic and power.  Both of the new races come with new mounts to ride and even new level 1 pets.<br><br>The expansion extends the level cap to 70 and the majority of the content is for characters level 60 to 70 with the exception of the two starting areas for the new races that offer enough quests to get characters up to level 20 before heading out into the rest of Azeroth.

	des := 'Two hundred years after the events described in Oblivion, the continent of Tamriel is in turmoil. The Emperor''s throne remained without heir; the Blades, Empire''s elite guards, have been disassembled; elven nations began capturing territory from the Empire. The assassination of the King of Skyrim, Tamriel''s Northern-most province and home of the Nord race, led to a civil war between those who wish independence for Skyrim and those who wanted it to remain under the Empire''s control. <br><br>A prisoner is brought to a small town, awaiting execution for alleged involvement with the Stormcloaks, a group that was founded by the king''s assassin Ulfric Stormcloak. Just before the executioner''s axe lands on the prisoner''s neck, a dragon attacks the city, forcing most people to flee. The unexpected freedom leads the ex-prisoner into the snowy Skyrim, where the rumors of the dragon begin to circulate.<br><br>Like its predecessors in the <i>Elder Scrolls</i> series, <i>Skyrim</i> is an open-ended role-playing game with action-based combat. The player may explore the vast environments of Skyrim from either first- (default) or third-person perspective, being unrestricted in his or her travels and free to undertake any side quests in any order, or follow the main quest. It is possible to fast-travel to previously visited locations directly from the world map. The player can also opt to buy (or steal) and ride a horse.<br><br>There are ten races to choose from:  Altmer (High Elves), Argonian (reptile people), Bosmer (Wood Elves), Breton, Dunmer (Dark Elves), Imperial, Khajiit (cat people), Nord, Orc, and Redguard.  Each race has their own perks and limitations, such as Nord being resistant to cold, Khajiit being weak with magic, etc. Unlike the previous games in the series, the player cannot choose a class for the main character; rather, the latter evolves into any class-like combination gradually, according to the play style. When the protagonist reaches a new level, the player may increase his or her Health, Magicka, or Stamina and a new perk may be added to one of the skills. There are eighteen skills altogether, and each skill has several levels and perks which may be obtained.  Most perks are only accessible after a certain level has been reached in said perk.  For instance, in order to reach higher perks with Destruction, destructive spells must be leveled up.  Skill levels can increase either through extensive use, skill books, or even paying for training from certain non-playable characters.  <br><br>The game contains some features that were introduced in Fallout 3. Enemy level-scaling is done in a similar way, as opposed to the more intrusive system of <i>Oblivion</i>. The player may hire other fighters to follow the hero around and lend a helping hand in combat.  Also, the lockpicking system of the previous installment has been replaced by the lockpicking methods of the recent <i>Fallout</i> games. Conversations with NPCs now occur in real time rather than "freezing" time as in <i>Oblivion</i>. <br><br>Players can craft, cook, or build any number of items depending on ingredients and skill levels.  Alchemy allows players to make potions, Enchanting allows players to imbue armor and items with magical abilities (such as increasing the effectiveness of magic resistance), and Smithing allows players to either craft or improve weapons and armor.  Smelting, tanning and cooking are also a part of this mix as well:  Smelting is the skill of turning raw mined mineral ores into usable ingots for smithing; Tanning is the process of drying animal hides to make leather strips, useful in creating or improving armor and weapons; Cooking allows players to turn otherwise minimally useful food ingredients into much more beneficial meals.  <br><br>Melee attacks can be performed using either two or one-handed weapons. Blocking reduces damage and allows for the opportunity to bash an opponent with a shield. Archery is also available for some ranged attacks, as is quite a bit of magicka. Each race also has a distinct magic-like power ability; only one power may be equipped at a time. For instance, a Nord power is to frighten enemies away for a while. New to the series is the Shout ability, which is a special power based on Dragon language. These require a special set of circumstances to unlock: first, the ancient words must be learned from Word Walls hidden all over Skyrim; secondly, they can only be activated by acquiring a dragon soul (from slaying a dragon).  <br><br>Crimes may be committed by stealing, pickpocketing, murder or attacking innocent people, or even by trespassing.  Generally this puts a bounty on the head of the player character, unless said character is quick enough to eliminate all witnesses.  Fines and jail time, or a beat-down from authorities, are likely to ensue if the hero commits too many crimes or merely ends up getting caught.  The protagonist can serve out his or her sentence on the jail bed, or pick the lock and escape; however, going to jail is likely to cause current skill progress to be lost.  <br><br>As before, there are several groups, guilds, and the like that the player may encounter and join, each with their own advantages or disadvantages, each with their own views on the current events of the world, and each with their own quests. The abilities to become a werewolf or vampire are also present and have been somewhat streamlined: for instance, sunlight is not instantly deadly to vampires, and lycanthropy can be spread around.  #REQUISITOS#OS: Windows 7/Vista/XP<br/>Processor: 2GHz Dual Core CPU or equivalent<br/>RAM: 2 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 7 GB<br/>Video: DirectX 9.0c compatible Graphics Card with 512 MB VRAM<br/>Sound: DirectX compatible Sound Card';

But the player''s creature is not alone and other, friendly or not-so-friendly organisms float about. If the player kills other alpha organisms, he unlocks a new part for the creature editor like a new mouth. These parts all give the player''s creature different abilities including singing or a better attack and even affect what the creature can eat. As the player collect''s DNA points, the creature grows and moves up into a higher layer of the primordial soup until he is big enough to advance to the next stage: the creature phase.<br><br>At the beginning of the <i>Creature Phase</i> the player needs to redo his creature in the creature editor with a new set of parts like feet or hands. Then the goal is again to collect DNA points by roaming the land and befriending or killing the other inhabitants. Again there can be additional parts for the editor found which are dropped by alpha creature that get killed either by you or other, bigger creatures. If the player chooses not to attack but rather talk to the other races, he needs to gain their trust by following their lead and doing what they do. While the lowest creatures see you as a friend already when you just sing with them, more advanced races require a high level in dancing and other abilities which are again gained by rebuilding the creature in the editor with the gained DNA points and available parts.

It retains many elements of the previous games in the series, while somewhat shifting the emphasis from social interaction and ethical role-playing to exploration of an open, continuous 3D world and combat. The player is free to explore the game''s world from the beginning, visiting many optional locations, talking to characters and completing side quests. The main quest line, however, is largely linear, posing moral choices to the player only during its final phase. <br><br>Character creation and customization are similar to those of the previous games.

Tactical turn-based battles from the previous games have been replaced with two different combat modes; the player is able to switch between them at any time.

The player character equips a weapon (ranging from a baseball bat to the destructive mini-nuke-launcher) and attacks enemies with it; damage calculation is based on the participants'' statistics more than on the player''s dexterity, though the latter plays a role as well. In addition, the player can opt to switch to Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.) combat mode, a real-time system that allows the player to pause the game at any time and target specific regions of one or more enemies until the available action points are used. After all the actions have been assigned, the game plays them out in a slow motion.<br><br>The Karma system from the previous installments is back, keeping track of the main character''s actions and decisions made by the player throughout the course of the game.

The player takes control of Carl Johnson (C.J.), who had moved to Liberty City in order to distance itself from his past as a member of a gang in his home city, San Andreas. But the past catches up with him in a way he had not imagined: he finds out that his mother was killed by a rival gang. He goes back to San Andreas to attend her funeral. Realizing how corrupted local police is, seeing how his relatives and friends need him, determined to avenge his mother''s death, C. J. has no other choice but revert to his old ways.<br><br><i>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</i> is the fifth game in the <i>GTA</i> series. The basic premise remains the same: roam the "sandbox" environments, hijack cars, and complete missions to advance the story. The game''s world is significantly larger than in its two immediate predecessors, encompassing three cities and a vast countryside between them, with smaller towns, mountains, rivers, and other places of interest. The interactivity with the environment is enhanced, since the player character can now swim and dive, being able to access every corner of the game world.<br><br>The missions vary in structure and gameplay, including chases, races, longer and more intense third-person shooter sequences, as well as a wide variety of vehicles to navigate, which range from different new types of cars (such as lowriders), bicycles, motorcycles, to boats, helicopters, planes, trains, and exotic devices such as monster trucks and jetpacks. Some of the missions involve recruiting gang members and attacking turfs belonging to rival gangs.<br><br>As in the previous games, there are many activities to perform outside of the missions. Working as a taxi driver, taking part in races, delivering sick people to hospital, etc., return from the preceding games in the series. <i>San Andreas</i> adds many new activities of its own, some of them with a role-playing flavor. C.J. can go to gym and work out, increasing his stamina. From time to time he has to eat - though overeating will make him look fatter. He is also able to have romantic relationships with certain female characters, asking them out on a dinner, giving them presents, etc.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows 2000/XP<br/>Processor: Pentium III 1 Ghz or equivalent<br/>RAM: 256 MB<br/>Hard Drive: 3.6 GB<br/>Video: GeForce 3 64MB<br/>Sound: Yes';

	des := '<i>Star Wars: The Old Republic</i> is an MMORPG set in the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, in a time called the Old Republic when a cold war has split the galaxy between the Republic and the Sith Empire. The player character is one of several classes and will follow a specific storyline for that class. Gameplay consists of open environments with enemies that need to be fought, special instances for groups of characters called flash points, and arenas for fighting the other faction of the game, called war zones. During the game the player is led from one scene to another. Each scene is called a planet and consist of a series of locations closely linked and gives some hours or days of gameplay.<br><br>The character evolves with time and gets better and ready to meet harder enemies, even on one planet the content becomes incrementally harder, but is kept on the level that it is matched against the character''s supposed evolution. After the first two planets the freedom of choice is much more expanded and the game world, the galaxy, gets more accessible. The gameplay gets more sophisticated as you can make choices to send your characters on exploration in locations that are meant for more evolved characters.<br><br>From the start and following the character through her progression, different types of missions are available. The missions gives the character''s presence in the locations a meaning and a goal. They usually involve a lot of killing and some conversations where guile can come in handy. Most of the missions are voluntary and at least early on is it possible to progress without getting involved. There are some special missions that character is supposed to follow, called the class story line. It is possible to play the game even if one chooses not to do the class story line but it will limit the available choices a lot. At the start of every mission and at some key moments of the mission there are dialogues where the gameplay is stopped and a cut-scene is played followed by a series of multi choice questions. The choices are limited but the outcome could be affected by them. The characters'' answers are delivered "in character", with some fitting attitude. It is in several cases possible to choose a non-violent before a violent solution. Also all NPCs in the game are voiced. Missions give rewards in the form of items that are connected with the reward giver and sometimes special reputation tokens. Credits and experience is routinely given as a reward.<br><br>In addition to the general gameplay with the storyline there are more general arenas, as usual in MMORPGs. These include Heroic Missions that are repeatable missions intended to be manageable only when grouped with more players; Flash Points that are heroic missions taking place in a special location separated from the normal game play world; War Zones that are player-versus-player arenas for group fights. The latter also are special locations separated from the normal game play world. Finally there are Space battles, that are single player arcade games where the player navigates his space ship through a space battle scenario.<br><br>At the start of the game is the player able to choose a side, Republic or Empire, and then one of the four classes available for each side. The player can then customize the looks by choosing race, body type and some other features. There are no other choices of proficiency or alignment in the character setup. During the game the character evolves and can make choices on what to be good at and by choices in the missions choose a light or a dark side. Through the missions the character will get to know some non-player-characters and some of them will be companions of the character if the player follows the class story line. The companions do evolve they too, at the choice of the player. Through the class story line each character is eventually awarded a space ship that is somewhat customizable.<br><br>As with many large-scale MMORPGs the players are divided over different servers. The servers are grouped into timezones and per language. Each server is given a designation as PVE, PVP or RP-PVP. On each server players can communicate with each other and form guilds.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows XP (Service Pack 3), Vista, 7<br/>Processor: AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core 4000+ or better, Intel Core 2 Duo Processor 2.0 GHz or better<br/>RAM: Windows XP: 1.5 GB, Windows Vista and Windows 7: 2GB, PCs using a built-in graphic chipset: 2 GB<br/>Hard Drive: N/A<br/>Video: 256 MB of on-board RAM and Shader model 3.0 or better support (ATI Radeon X1800 or better, NVIDIA GeForce 7800 or better, Intel 4100 Integrated Graphics or better).<br/>Sound: Yes';

The player takes on the role of the US soldier Jake Dunn. On a remote Pacific island a meteor has been excavated and the North Korean army quickly moved in to secure the location. After they capture a team of US archaeologists the US Army sends in a Delta Force team to investigate and free the scientists. Most of the missions are played along, but often with a AI squad that also star in the cutscenes and play a crucial part in the story.<br><br>During the battles with the North Korean soldiers it becomes apparent that there is an even greater threat. When the meteor opens up a huge alien ship is revealed that starts to xenoform the island by freezing it over. The Americans and North Koreans are forced to join forces when alien machines emerge from the vessel and attack both sides. Now both sides have to stop the xenoforming process together.<br><br><i>Crysis</i> offers a singleplayer campaign as well as an objective based multiplayer for up to 32 players. One of the main innovations of the game is the so called Nanosuit. This high tech combat suit allows the player to increase his speed, strength or speed for short amounts of time. Jake Dunn and his fellow soldiers can get into a cloaking mode, become invisible and it restores health when powered up.<br><br>In the single player campaign the player will encounter several enemy types. A large part is spent fighting North-Korean soldiers. Aliens are first encountered in a Zero-G environment once the meteorite has been breached. When leaving the meteorite the actual alien invasion begins and the player then mainly faces small alien scouts and the larger alien hunters.<br><br>During the campaign there are a number of more or less typical shooter weapons to be gathered, such as machineguns, a shotgun, a missile launcher, a sniper rifle, explosives, various types of grenades and a gauss gun. In the later weapons there are also some alien weapons which can freeze opponents. Not all weapons can be held at once, they can be swapped for the ones from the bodies of dead soldiers and most of the weapons have a limited amount of ammo. There is also an extensive weapons upgrade feature which is available from the start and allows the player to reconfigure weapon configurations on the fly. Tactical or explosive ammunition can be added, or a flashlight, a laserscope, a silencer, grenades and more. Most of the weapons have multiple firing options, from single bullets to rapid bursts.<br><br>Almost any vehicle can be driven, from jeeps to large vans, regular cars, tanks and patrol boats. Most of these have mounted weapons. Other equipment includes binoculars, nightvision, a radar with targets in the bottom left corner of the screen and a direct voice connection with other squad members.<br><br>Just like Crytek''s previous game <i>Far Cry</i>, it comes with a sandbox editor to create new levels.

A Combine Citadel is erected in City 17, a town in Eastern Europe reminiscent of World War II ghettos. Dr. Wallace Breen, a human scientist, rules the city on behalf of his new masters. An energy field prevents humans from procreating, and no new children are born. Earth is turning into a grim, oppressive police state.<br><br>Meanwhile, Gordon Freeman, the man who was at the center of the events that took place shortly before the rise of the Combine, awakens from his stasis and is inserted into a train to City 17 by the mysterious G-man. Gordon is soon brought into a resistance group, and makes a seemingly futile attempt to bring down the Combine and liberate the Earth. <br><br><i>Half-Life 2</i> is a linear first-person shooter with light puzzle-solving elements and many setpieces, similar to its predecessor in concept. The player guides Gordon Freeman through the City 17 and the wilderness that surrounds it. On his way, he''ll encounter a few friendly characters, but also fight dangerous foes. The game features a realistic physics system: Gordon can pick up objects and toss them freely, and many of the puzzles are physics-based - for example, at one point the player has to weigh down a seesaw with bricks at one end to turn it into a ramp. <br><br>Gordon''s enemies, apart from alien wildlife which found its way to Earth, are mainly Combine forces, which utilize a variety of firearms, gadgets and vehicles. Policemen and foot soldiers work along with helicopters, gunships and gigantic walking machines to hunt him down. To defend himself, Gordon has a range of weapons available: from the iconic crowbar for close-quarter fighting, through pistols and rifles, up to grenades and a rocket launcher. One of the most notable weapons is the gravity gun, with which Gordon can pick up objects, hold them in the gun''s anti-gravity field, then hurl them at the enemy with great force. <br><br>Setpieces in the game include co-ordinated assaults on enemy bases, fighting gigantic boss enemies, bringing down aircrafts with the rocket launcher, and others. A few levels require the player to navigate buggy-type vehicles. Some of the more exotic stages involve the player summoning an army of antlions to unleash on unsuspecting foes.<br><br>Included with the game is Counter-Strike: Source, a version of Counter-Strike made with the new Source engine which powers <i>Half-Life 2</i>, and Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, an online multiplayer game featuring the same physics and weapons as the single player game.#REQUISITOS#OS: XP/Vista/Windows7, OSX<br/>Processor: 1.7 GHz Processor<br/>RAM: 512MB<br/>Hard Drive: 1.1GB<br/>Video: DirectX® 8.1 level Graphics Card<br/>Sound: Yes';

The world is heavily divided between those with augmentations and those who do not, with the latter fearing the former following the ending of the previous game. This division is known as the "mechanical apartheid".<br><br>As with the previous game, players will investigate the bombing by speaking to characters, exploring the environment, and completing missions however they choose.Various actions, such as completing quests, finding alternate routes, hacking terminals, and neutralizing enemies earn the player Praxis points, which they can use to activate Jensen''s mechanical augmentations.

	des := '<i>Far Cry 3</i> is an open world first-person shooter set on the fictional Rook archipelago in the Pacific. Even though the tropical setting resembles the original Far Cry, the gameplay itself is closer to Far Cry 2 as the open world exploration is supplemented by role-playing elements with experience points, crafting, trading, hunting and three skills trees.<br><br>The protagonist is Jason Brody, a daredevil who is on a holiday in the Pacific with his two brothers and some friends. When they take a skydiving trip, they land on an island that is controlled by pirates. They are all taken prisoner by the pirate warlord Vaas and his older brother Grant is killed when they attempt to escape. Vaas sarcastically gives Jason an opportunity of 30 seconds to escape before he hunts him down. Against all odds, Jason succeeds by jumping into the water. He is rescued by Dennis Rogers who introduces him to the Rakyat, the native tribe that hopes to rid the island off the pirates. During the search for the remaining survivors Jason will be initiated into the mysticism of the tribe, discover the environment and hunt down Vaas. After the introduction the player is however largely free to leave the main quest along and discover the islands at his own pace and leisure, as all of the playable area is available right away.<br><br>The rook archipelago is a dangerous environment filled with pirate settlements and local animals such as tigers, bears, sharks, komodo dragons, boars, goat, snakes, rabid dogs etc. It is split up into different sections that are revealed gradually as soon as a radio tower in the sector has been taken over. These reveal the entire environment and open up quests, but areas can also be traversed without a detailed map. There are various safe houses to travel around and exchange loot at all-purpose vending machines. Players can kill pirates, complete quests, but also collect plants and hunt down animals for their skin. Money is exchanged for weapons, modifications and items such as syringes, but crafting also plays an important role. By discovering recipes, plants can be turned into fluids that are injected to enhance abilities. In addition animals skins are used to craft items that extend Jason''s weapon belt up to four slots, provide a larger wallet to store money, increase his ammo belt and a lot more. Completing quests and killing pirates is rewarded with skill points that are used on one of the three available skill trees. These determine the playing style, as Heron deals with mobility and long-range attacks, Spider with stealth and survival, and Shark with assault and healing. For each new skill acquired, Jason receives a tattoo on his arm.<br><br>Even though it is a shooter with machine guns, assault rifles, hand guns, bows, flamethrowers, mines, RPGs and grenades, almost all of the game can be played with a stealth approach. Jason can crouch and hide in the foliage to remain hidden. A meter shows how visible he is to opponents. By sneaking up on them stealth takedowns with a knife can be performed and bodies can be dragged away. He can also throw rocks or use sounds to isolate pirates. His camera is used to zoom in and mark opponents. Once they are marked they remain visible through an outline even when there are walls or objects in the way, helping to track movement. The same can be done with animals. Moving around is done by foot, but there are also different vehicles such as cars, jeeps, quads, boats, jet skis and paragliders along with zip lines and swimming to move more quickly.<br><br>If Jason chooses to help the natives, he can infiltrate and take over more than 30 outposts. Once these settlements are cleared, they become property of the natives and a safe house for fast travel and shopping is offered. Every animal and character has dynamic behavior, acting regardless of Jason''s actions. That way he can observe animals attacking each other or use it to his advantage to clear a group of enemies, and villagers will move out and conquer more territory independently once Jason clears an outpost. Enemies patrol around the island on foot or in cars with non-scripted behavior. Once Jason is discovered, they will often call in reinforcements from another location and chase him down. Additional ammo and weapons can be picked up from fallen enemies, and money and items are also collected that way, along with many hidden loot chests and additional collectibles such as letters from fallen soldiers during World War II and relics. Weapons that are bought can be re-acquired at any time without an additional cost from the vending machine even when they were lost or exchanged during a quests. Weapons can further be customized through various modifications such as scopes, laser pointers, silencers and more room for ammo.<br><br>Multiplayer consists of a separate cooperative campaign for up to four players that takes place six months before the events of the main game. It is set on a separate island of the Rook archipelago and features four characters: a thug called Callum, the crooked cop Leonard, the Russian hitman Mikhail and ex-soldier Tisha. They were redeeming their past actions by working on a cruise ship when they are scammed out of their money by the pirates. By pursuing them, they end up on the island. The campaign is split up into six missions that take about an hour each, interspersed with cut-scenes. The missions typically have the characters working together to travel to a location, killing all enemies and then completing objectives such as protecting equipment, finding a specific type of ammo or guarding another player. Experience is also gained here and there are multiplayer unlockables and custom loadouts. Competitive elements between players are also encouraged, such as getting the most sniping kills for instance, with an additional experience bonus. Two additional elements are battle cry and booster systems. Battle cries are temporary buffs that affect team mates in the vicinity and boosters are stronger buffs provided through syringes.<br><br>The competitive multiplayer modes include team deathmatch, domination, transmission and firestorm. Transmission and firestorm are similar to domination. Transmission is about radio transmitters as control points but they sometimes change locations. Firestorm has each team set fire simultaneously to two fuel dumps held by the other team, while defending their own. Once a successful fire has been achieved, almost the entire environment becomes ablaze and the teams then need to fight over a radio control point. Additional multiplayer bonuses and perks are gathered by unlocking encrypted data with a time limit. In these modes players can also level up through a permanent system and use battles cries, booster systems, revive team mates or call in support. After matches there are interactive cut-scenes where players can choose to show mercy or punish (kill) opponents.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows 7<br/>Processor: 2.66 GHz Intel® Core2 Duo E6700 or 3.00 GHz AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+ or better<br/>RAM: 4 GB<br/>Hard Drive: N/A<br/>Video: 512 MB DirectX 9.0c-compliant card with Shader Model 3.0 or higher<br/>Sound: Yes';

Now a number of heroes from a variety of organizations and walks of life have come together to fill the void Overwatch left.<br><br><i>Overwatch</i> is a first-person shooter in which two teams of six players each battle to complete objectives or hinder their opponents from doing such. Playable heroes are divided into four classes based broadly on the role they are meant to play: offense, defense, tank, and support. Each hero has their own unique abilities and gameplay mechanics, and players can switch to a different hero mid-match in order to better aid their team. Objectives are different on each map, and can include overseeing the delivery of a payload object to a specific location, capturing or defending specific areas of the map, or a combination of the two.<br><br>At the conclusion of a match, the server selects and replays a number of highlights from specific players, which both teams must then vote on. The player with the most votes is awarded the "Play of the Game" and earns bonus experience points. Experience goes towards levels, which in turn award players with loot crates that contain random cosmetic items for the heroes. Alternatively, in-game currency can be earned to directly buy certain cosmetic items, and real-world currency can be used to buy additional loot crates.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows Vista/7/ 8/10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)<br/>Processor: Intel Core i3 or AMD Phenom X3 8650<br/>RAM: 4 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 30 GB<br/>Video: Nvidia GeForce GTX 460, ATI Radeon HD 4850, or Intel HD Graphics 4400<br/>Sound: Yes (recommended)';

After having stolen the Death Star plans from a remote facility, he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base. This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various iterations of his Dark Troopers - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and firepower to turn the tide of the war.<br><br><i>Dark Forces</i> is a close prequel to the original <i>Star Wars</i> movie trilogy. The game marks LucasArts'' first attempt to enter the first-person shooter market. Instead of licensing the DOOM engine, like many competitors, LucasArts created its own internal Jedi engine. The Jedi engine contains advanced features over similar tech, including the ability to look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited support (in the build used for <i>Dark Forces</i>) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. The 3D models also make occasional appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle''s ship dropping him off or picking him up from each mission. <br><br>Most levels have a fairly complex, often maze-like structure, and include various switches that need to be activated to change the layout of the level. Jumping is integrated into the gameplay, as certain areas can only be accessed in that way. In addition to weapons, Kyle can use shields to protect himself from damage, a head lamp to illuminate dark areas, as well as specific items used to counter environmental hazards. The player character is given a certain amount of "lives" per level; he dies permanently once he runs out of all of them. Game progress can be saved only between missions.<br><br>The game features fourteen substantial levels as Kyle works to disarm the Dark Trooper project. Many levels reference characters or areas from the <i>Star Wars</i> movie trilogy, such as a visit with Jabba the Hutt, a trip to Coruscant, and a battle through the interior of a Star Destroyer. As opposed to most first-person shooters of the time period, every level has objectives for Kyle to complete, ranging from grabbing a clue and getting out alive, to planting charges around a facility to demolish it.  Cutscenes appear between key missions to update the plot.<br><br>The <i>Star Wars</i> license gets plenty of use, as the game features imperial officers, stormtroopers, and a collection of aliens seen in the films as enemies. Blaster rifles and thermal detonators are used as weapons, along with other firearms inspired by the tech of the films. <i>Dark Forces</i> also uses the iMuse engine to dynamically change the music during action scenes, with much of the music based off or directly replicating, John Williams'' original film score.<br><br>The game is entirely a single-player campaign; no multiplayer is included or supported.#REQUISITOS#OS: MS-DOS 5.0<br/>Processor: 486DX/33<br/>RAM: 8MB<br/>Hard Drive: N/A<br/>Video: VGA/MCGA<br/>Sound: Sound Blaster, Sound Blaster Pro, Sound Blaster 16, AWE 32, Pro Audio Spectrium, Roland MT32/LAPC-1, Ensoniq Soundscape, Gravis UltraSound, General Midi';

	des := '<i>XCOM: Enemy Unknown</i> is a turn-based tactical strategy game that incorporates role-playing elements and it is a reimagined remake of X-COM: UFO Defense. The game is set in the near future when Earth is invaded by aliens. The player is put at the head of the elite multinational military organization XCOM (Extraterrestrial Combat Unit) tasked to defend Earth against the invaders as regularly military actions remain without result. This is done through a series of missions where the player commands a small troop. Between missions the larger management aspect is tackled through research and development to create new technologies and weapons using captured aliens and technology recovered from the missions. That way, the underground HQ is expanded to have a larger reach with new structures and the player is also responsible for the management of finances and monitoring alien activity. Players also need to keep panic under control. If a certain region of country is left unattended for too long, the local government will cut back its contributions to the XCOM funding, slowing down the overall progress. There are also often cut-scenes that further an overall story.<br><br>For missions a squad of four to six soldiers is selected from a pool of about twenty. Missions are set in small areas usually centered around a specific building. Missions are shown from a 3D isometric-style, floating view and a fog of war shrouds most of the environment until the soldiers uncover it with their line of sight. Solid walls often become invisible while browsing to provide a full view of the environment. After guiding soldiers and determining a plan of attack, it is possible to switch to a much closer tactical view to decide how to attack. The action is done in turns and percentages are used based on the soldiers'' abilities and positions to determine how successful actions are. Terrains are often fully destructible leading to situations where new cover needs to be sought or the strategy needs to be altered after a part of the environment has been blown up. That way both active camouflage and suppressive fire can be used to maneuver around enemies. Soldiers are promoted to a certain class (Assault, Heavy, Sniper or Support) based on their actions in their first mission. Promotions open up access to special support abilities with additional weapons. Soldiers can be fully customized in appearance, abilities (also healing) and loadout. Next to regular weapons some aliens such as the Thin Man can poison soldiers from a distance and later on aliens are introduced with psionic abilities. Through salvaging and research, these also become available to the player. Soldiers that return from the missions need time to heal and cannot be assigned to a new missions right away with full health and abilities, so multiple squads need to be managed.<br><br>For the 70 missions there are ones that are pre-built and are identical for every player. The others (the majority) are randomly generated based on the player''s overall progress. Rather than completely randomizing everything, maps are selected from a pool of 80 with random enemy placement. Usually a mission follows the crash landing of aliens and there are always three countries asking for help. The player can only choose one and that influences the relationship and funding. A decision can be made based on the amount of panic in the region or the reward offered (usually new scientists or engineers). The money is also spent on launching satellites to track alien activity through a holographic view of the Earth called Geoscape, but a lot of them are needed as they only have a limited reach. At the same time satellites are often attacked, so interceptors need to be constructed to defend them. Satellites can only be launched from special silos and cost a lot of money. That way, balanced management is the only way to keep everything under control while a steady growth need to be maintained.<br><br>The campaign can be played in Ironman mode where the game cannot be saved during missions. In one-on-one multiplayer games can be played with a mix of humans and aliens in a single squad, which is not possible in the single-player campaign. Elements from the original game not present are the inventory system, the time unit system and the grid map that is always visible. Troops also are deployed right away and do not need to disembark from the transport.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows Vista<br/>Processor: 2 GHz Dual Core <br/>RAM: 2 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 20 GB<br/>Video: GeForce 8600GT or Radeon 2600XT<br/>Sound: Yes';

Disappointed by life, he immigrates to the United States, which his cousin Roman enthusiastically describes as a country of wealth and pleasure. However, the reality is quite different: Roman is poor, has no stable job, and owes money to some dubious individuals. As Niko attempts to help his hapless cousin and pave a more secure future for both of them, he becomes more and more involved in the life of crime. A burning desire to find a man who had betrayed him in Serbia forces Niko to make deals with his conscience, and once he crosses the line, there is no way back...<br><br><i>Grand Theft Auto IV</i> is the ninth title and the fourth main game in the <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> series, and also the first for the seventh generation of consoles. Following the tradition of the 3D installments of the series, the game is entirely located in one of the three cities of the original GTA, Liberty City, but now in present time, and with an environment reminiscent of GTA III, though bigger and more detailed. Liberty City is heavily based on New York, where the protagonist has to gain respect, welfare and power throughout the game. <br><br>Like in most <i>GTA</i> games, the city map is gradually uncovered during the course of the game. The player starts in Broker (based on Brooklyn), and, in order to access the other three districts of the city (based on the other major boroughs of New York City), has to make progress in the storyline. The game has the usual structure based on missions. The player can sometimes engage in various missions at the same time, and has free access to the non-mission features of the game while being on one.<br><br>Most of the usual elements of exploration and interaction with the city are included in <i>GTA IV</i>. Niko can cause mayhem in the city, hijack cars, listen to radio stations, observe the behavior of the citizens, enter thematic buildings, work as vigilante, taxi driver, or ambulance driver, hire a prostitute, go to a strip club, and so on. Among the new features is the possibility to watch television (with several channels broadcasting various fictional programs) and connect to a fictional Internet, with functional websites (mostly of a humorous nature) created specifically for the game, and an e-mail program. Other additions include looking for criminals in the police department database from a police car, hiring taxi cabs to safely travel to selected destinations, extensive usage of the mobile phone, improved A.I. of the pedestrians, and others. <br><br>Some features from the previous games are missing, such as drivable airplanes and a few other vehicle types. Niko retains the ability to swim and engage in romantic relationships with female characters, features first introduced in San Andreas. However, the light role-playing elements (training to increase stamina, eating, etc.) from the previous entry have been removed. <br><br><i>GTA IV</i>  focuses on third-person shooter gameplay more than the previous installments; most of the missions have larger portions dedicated to on-foot navigation and shooting. Crouching, leaning, and taking cover play a more important role in combat. Hand-to-hand combat has also been re-designed, Niko being able to execute more precise moves. <br><br>The game uses the euphoria motion engine, an alternate middleware solution much like ragdoll physics, which makes all people in the game world move realistically depending on the situation around them. For example, every time Niko enters a car, a different animation will be generated depending on his position relative to the car.<br><br>A new feature compared to the predecessors is the multiplayer. The same free-roaming environment is offered for up to 16 players (32 in the Windows version) in 15 modes. Certain modes narrow down the environment to make sure players remain somewhat in each other''s vicinity.

Many basic elements from its predecessor are borrowed, with the change of scenery as a notable difference; the game moves away from the jungle environment on a tropical island, as featured in Crytek''s earlier title Far Cry as well, to a darker urban warfare scenery set in the destroyed cityscape of a future New York City in 2023, three years after the events of the first game.<br><br>The player assumes the role of Alcatraz, a force recon marine and a different protagonist than in the first game. New York City is ravaged and partially under martial law after an outbreak of the Manhattan virus that causes cellular breakdown. At the same time the city is struck by an infestation of the alien race Ceph, which was also present in the original game. Alcatraz is initially deployed as a regular marine as a part of C.E.L.L., a private military organization part of Crynet who developed the nanosuit. During the course of an early mission Alcatraz ends up by himself and meets the infected major Laurence Barnes who owns an updated 2.0 version of the suit. He passes it on to Alcatraz who consequently has to take on the Ceph as well as fight off C.E.L.L. soldiers, who assume he is Barnes because of the suit. Crynet hunts Barnes because he is an active biohazard through the infection and has stated criticism of the side effects that come along with wearing the suit.<br><br>Most of the game takes place fighting through the city, but there are also minor parts where a vehicle can be driven. Next to melee attacks (stomping, kicking, punching), a large number of weapons and explosives, there is a large focus on the abilities of the nanosuit, as implied by the game''s promotional slogan "Be the Weapon". The suit has a limited amount of energy that needs to be recharged regularly. The suit''s four modes of the original game have been brought back to two. Aside from the default Weapon mode, players can access Cloak and Armor as the two main modes. Cloaks provides invisibility and suppresses sounds, while Armor strengthens protection. The suit can further be customized through many modules that provide specific abilities. Speed and Jump are still presented as additional abilities, but they are activated automatically when the player sprints or holds down the jump button respectively. These, along with many other modules, are called passive secondary powers because they drain energy when they are activated. In the other, secondary Tactical mode, items, buildings and enemies can be tagged through a tactical visor. This leaves the player in a vulnerable position with no weapon, but consumes no energy. A major difference to the first game is that multiple suit powers can be enabled at the same time. Other abilities are hit detection (shows the general direction of incoming bullets) and different weapon attachments.<br><br>The suit modes allow for different approaches to levels, based on brute force or stealth. A HUD shows a tactical radar with a basic map of the immediate terrain, nearby enemies, and a stealth meter that shows whether enemies are aware of your presence. Freedom of movement is more restricted than in the first game through the narrower city design, but there are many ways to progress through levels, and a larger focus on the verticality of the environment and using objects for cover and stealth, along with parkours-like movement that includes sliding and climbing up ledges.<br><br>The included multiplayer modes support up to twelve players simultaneously. The game modes are Instant Action (free for all), Team Instant Action (team-based death match), Crash Site (steal energy from alien pods), Assault (nanosuit operatives must download data from terminals defended by black ops soldiers), Capture the Relay, and Extraction (extract alien bio-ticks from defended locations).<br><br>The game supports stereoscopic 3D.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows XP<br/>Processor: Core 2 Duo 2 Ghz</>RAM: 3 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 9 GB<br/>Video: GeForce 8800GT or Radeon 3850<br/>Sound: Yes';

Beginning with a single settler to found a city, players are tasked with exploring their surroundings, growing their empire, researching new technologies to aid them, and negotiating with other, rival civilizations - trading with them, forming alliances and pacts, or waging war.<br><br>While the basic concepts of this game are broadly similar to previous games in the series, some major changes have been made. Chief among these is a change from the squares-based map of all previous Civilization games to a hexagon-based system; now, moving in a diagonal offers the same movement as in any other direction (as opposed to a squares-based system, where a diagonal is strictly faster than either vertically or horizontally). In addition, religions have been removed from the game, while the policies system - allowing the player to customise their rule, gaining various perks or bonuses - has been significantly overhauled, requiring players to purchase policies with culture. Ranged units have also been tweaked, allowing archers to bombard enemy units or cities from afar.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows® XP SP3/ Windows® Vista SP2/ Windows® 7<br/>Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 1.8 GHz or AMD Athlon X2 64 2.0 GHz<br/>RAM: 2GB RAM<br/>Hard Drive: 8 GB Free<br/>Video: 256 MB ATI HD2600 XT or better, 256 MB nVidia 7900 GS or better, or Core i3 or better integrated graphics<br/>Sound: DirectX 9.0c-compatible sound card';

Jim Raynor managed the impossible, and with the help of Mengsk''s son, the young prince, and a handful of Dominion forces, he rescued Sarah Kerrigan from the clutches of Zerg influence and helped her regain her humanity. While she now appeared more human than when leading the Swarm, she still retained the ability to control the Zerg, but was stripped of her other powers. She might have even considered letting go of her grudge against Emperor Mengsk and leave it all behind with Jim, but when Dominion forces under Emperor Mengsk''s command attacked the facility she was at, Kerrigan and Jim got separated and not soon after she was led to believe that Jim was captured and executed. What once seemed like a peaceful escape turned into raging lust for vengeance. She was determined to regain her foothold among the Zerg and once again take the lead of the Swarm. But in order to achieve that, she would have to thread lightly as she lost her once immense influence over the Swarm. Led by vengeance, Kerrigan is set to become The Queen of Blades once again and finish Emperor Mengsk once and for all.<br><br>Unlike in base game, this add-on features hero characters much more often on the missions, so Kerrigan will be present during the most ambitious conflicts between her Swarm and the opposing forces. As such, she can level up and upgrade her skills and abilities between missions. But unlike that of Terrans, upgrades with Zerg Swarm can be changed at any point between missions. Only mutation upgrades are permanent. Missions are much more versatile than in <i>Wings of Liberty</i>, new planets are introduced, new map terrain, and a plethora of new and upgraded units, both Zerg and other. While basic Zerg units can select one of the three existing upgrades changeable at any time during or between missions, evolution mutations are permanent. Before Zerg units can evolve, you will have to play evolution missions which will introduce both strains of evolution for the units, and then select the best suitable one for your campaign.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows 7<br/>Processor: Core 2 Duo 2 Ghz</>RAM: 2 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 30 GB<br/>Video: GeForce 7600GT or Radeon 2600XT<br/>Sound: Yes';

The game is set in Kyrat, a fictional region based on the Himalayan regions of Nepal. It is governed by the depostic king Pagan Min. The player controls Ajay Ghale, an American with Kyrati roots who returns to the region to disperse his deceased mother''s ashes. As soon as he arrives he is dragged into the conflict and is rescued by the rebel organization The Golden Path started by his parents. During the game the Ajay can eventually choose which force to side with, with different endings. Inside The Golden Path there is a power struggle, and Ajay can choose between missions for Amita or Sabal, with different objectives based on the choices.<br><br>The mountainous region has both lush environments and snowy mountains. Vertical heights can be scaled using a grappling hook, and a glider or a zipline is used to move down. The player can follow the story missions or explore freely. Various vehicles are available to cross the distances and there is a fast travel option for important locations. There is an auto drive option where vehicles follow the roads to the next waypoint while the player can concentrate on shooting. Typical game elements that return are hunting animals (rhinos, pigs, bears, eagles, wolves, elephants ...) to craft upgrades, collecting plants for syringes, exploring locations for loot that can be sold at shops, trading points and sherpas, and a large amount of weapons including a bow, both melee weapons and long-ranged guns, grenades, mines, and explosives. It is possible to ride elephants as well. Next to the main quest there are various side quests and random karma events for separate karma points. Next to money and experience gained to level up, skills points are provided. These can be spent in The Tiger (aggressive) or The Elephant (defensive) skill tree. There are also a large amount of collectibles such as propaganda posters, masks, lost letters and pages of Mohan Ghale''s journal.<br><br>Bell towers can be climbed to remove the fog from sections of the map. There are 24 outposts to infiltrate and four large fortresses. It is possible to reset outposts to take them over using another tactic. Guns for hire tokens can be used to call in back-up for tough missions. Just like the previous game a stealth approach is always possible. Ajay can shoot open cages or throw bait to use wild animals to cause havoc. Stones can be thrown as a distraction. Both animals and enemies can be tagged with the camera to track movement. An indicator shows if Ajay has been discovered and guards have different alert states. Enemies can be taken out silently using a takedown, a throwing knife, weapons with a suppressor or the bow. The hunter is a new type of enemy that moves silently and can only be tagged for a short time. They quickly disappear, attempt to take you out and can charm animals to attack you. The game has a day and night cycle and Ajay can now sleep in a bed for a certain amount of time to skip the night for instance.<br><br>The single-player campaign can be played cooperatively (except for the main story missions). When playing alone and in a difficult situation, you can send a request for help for someone to join you, and vice versa. Online multiplayer is also supported through Battles of Kyrat, with different types of game modes such as Outpost, Demon Mask or Propaganda. Players who do not own the game can be invited to play along using a limited amount of keys. A level editor is included as well.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows 7 64 bits<br/>Processor: i5-750 or x4 955</>RAM: 4 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 30 GB<br/>Video: GeForce GTX 460 or HD5850<br/>Sound: Yes';

She is held captive in the floating city of Columbia in alternate version of 1912. During his travels Booker encounters different factions within the city who are battling one another. The Founders want Columbia to remain a city only for pure Americans while the Vox Populi think the city should be available to anyone. The setting is built around the idea of exceptionalism with a strong religious doctrine and open racism. Elizabeth is a key piece within this conflict and has a mysterious origin including her powers to cause tears in the fabric of space-time, exposing parallel universes. Booker and Elizabeth remain together most of the game and she acts on her own. She does not need to be defended, tosses ammo and silver eagle coins to Booker and can be asked to pick locks. They are hunted down by the spiritual leader Comstock and his troops, along with the giant mechanical Songbird.<br><br>The game uses similar gameplay styles and mechanics found in previous <i>BioShock</i> games. Vigors give the player super powers to do a variety of things such as sending a murder of crows to peck away enemies or charming enemies to defend you. Another one is possession used to take over humans or machines to temporarily turn them into allies. Once the effect wears off, the possessed humans will commit suicide. Most vigors have multiple uses either as a direct attack or as a much stronger trap awaiting to be triggered. Booker can also be upgraded through four types of gear with permanent bonuses similar to the gene tonics in the previous games. Different types can be equipped according to the situation. The typical FPS array of weapons can be found throughout the game like pistols, shotguns, and rifles. One of the more notable weapons is the Sky Hook which can be used as a melee weapon to take down an enemy. Money can be exchanged at vending machines for upgrades and consumables. Items are found by looting barrels, desks and enemies. Vigors can only be executed when a sufficient amount of salt has been collected. The three main bars visible on the screen (health, salt and shield) can be extended by locating and using infusions. The story is also furthered through optional voxophones (audio logs) and kinetoscopes (film projectors).<br><br>Skylines provide a unique way to move throughout the world. Using the Sky Hook, the player can attached to these lines and quickly slide in one direction or another.  These can be used to escape overwhelming situations or used to reach higher ground to gain a combat edge.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows Vista<br/>Processor: Core 2 Duo 2.4 Ghz</>RAM: 2 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 20 GB<br/>Video: GeForce 8800GT or HD3870<br/>Sound: Yes';

	des := '<i>Black Ops II</i> is the ninth main title in the <i>Call of Duty</i> first-person shooter franchise and the sequel to Call of Duty: Black Ops. It is set primarily in the near future of 2025 with one third of the game also taking place in the late 1980s. The timelines and story are connected through the playable characters of Alex Mason and Frank Woods in the past, and David Mason  the son of Alex Mason  in the future timeline. The future missions also feature an aged Woods giving exposition for the 1980s backdrop and share the same villain, Raul Menendez, who''s decades long vendetta is the primary focus of the single player campaign. The plot centers on a new cold war between China and The United States over REE (Rare Earth Elements) and its manipulation by Menendez. It has an emphasis on unmanned drones and other robotic technology  a first for the series. Another first for the series is the ability to customize multiplayer-style loadouts before each mission as well as a far less linear campaign. The player can now make choices throughout the storyline that can affect small aspects such as the appearance of NPCs all the way to major decisions that can change the ending entirely. There are new sandbox-style missions dubbed Strike Force. Playing similar to a real-time strategy game, these missions give the player the opportunity to command troops and drones from an overhead view but with the option to zoom into any one of the units, at which point the gameplay switches to standard first-person shooter controls and gameplay. Strike Force is implemented within the campaign and has repercussions on the storyline depending on how the player performs. <br><br>Multiplayer comes with familiar game modes (Deathmatch, Domination, Kill Confirmed, etc)  and ranking. The loadout system has however been changed to a new ten-point system that is unlike any prior title in the series. Players are given 10 points to use on weapons, attachments, and perks, each costing 1 point. The game also introduces wildcards, players can choose up to 3, which allows players to break the rules of create-a-class by either, having three attachments on their primary weapon, two perks of the first tier, or more lethal grenades, but more points are used. The playercard, stats tracking and emblem creation from <i>Black Ops</i> return as well as theater mode and combat training (which is now integrated into multiplayer as a playlist). Dedicated servers return to the PC version albeit with restrictions. Players cannot host servers themselves; rather Activision hosts them and they must still be joined through the now standard matchmaking system. Killstreaks have been renamed scorestreaks as points now factor in as well as kills  encouraging less camping and more playing of the objective. New scorestreaks include lightning strikes (similar to napalm strikes and mortar strikes of the past), unmanned dragonfire drones which hunt down and kill enemy players, among others. Returning strikes include dogs, RC-XD exploding cars, and franchise standards such as the UAV and care packages. <br><br>The <i>Call of Duty: Elite</i> service is now free and new league matches have been introduced. Similar to games like StarCraft II, league matches put a player into a division (Bronze, Silver, etc) after which they play on a competitive ladder with other players of similar skill. League games have comprehensive stat tracking and leaderboards available to all players through the Elite service.<br><br>The Wii U version offer split-screen multiplayer with one player using the TV and another using the built-in display of the GamePad. In regular games the GamePad is used to customize the game to set up the loadouts and select the scorestreaks.<br><br>Pre-order version of the game includes bonus Nuketown 2025 map.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows Vista<br/>Processor: E8200 or x3 8750</>RAM: 2 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 25 GB<br/>Video: GeForce 8800GT or HD3870<br/>Sound: Yes';

	des := '<i>Dragon Age: Inquisition</i> is a role-playing game and the third main game in the <i>Dragon Age</i> series. It is set in the Thedas continent, the same fantasy world as the two previous games. It consist of two large countries: Ferelden (from Dragon Age: Origins) and Orlais, as well as the land inbetween. The story picks up after the events of the supplementary novels <i>Dragon Age: Asunder</i> and <i>The Masked Empire</i> describing a civil war in Orlais between the loyalists of the ruling Empress and a noble faction led by her cousin Grand Duke Gaspard. After the events of Dragon Age II  the Circle of Magi has gone rogue and the mages are at war with the Templar Order seceded from the Chantry. The player''s character enters the game world from the Fade, a breach to another dimension caused by an explosion at a peace conference between mages and templars. Many clerics, including their leader the Divine, are killed and initially the player''s character is held responsible for that, as the only survivor to come out of the blast. The character has however no memory of what has happened, but discovers powers that are capable of closing rifts as is then referred to as the Herald of Andraste. The initial premise is to close these rifts, with the help of the former associates of the Divine, Cassandra and Leliana, former templar Cullen and ambassador Josephine. Following the Divine''s last orders they establish the Inquisition, an independent group to close the rifts and bring those behind it to justice.<br><br>True to the spirit of the series the character can be customized for appearance, sex, class and race. The available races are dwarf, elf, human, and Qunari and the classes are mage, rogue, and warrior with three specializations each. To grow the Inquisition experience needs to be earned by completing quests, which allows the player to further define allegiances and pursue romances. A custom party can be defined and each member benefits from experience as it opens up access to better weapons and more abilities. Power points open up new areas and Inquisition points define the influence over the region; each new level provides a perk that benefits the entire Inquisition. The main hub for quests is the Inquisition''s war table. The War Council consists of Cassandra (also available as a party member), as well as Cullen, Josephine and Leliana. The latter three advisers can be assigned tasks to complete on their own to progress, unlocking new characters, quests and areas.<br><br>The party of four travels to different regions, mainly with the main goal to close a rift and defeat a rival faction, but there are also many sidequests not related to the main story, along with the allegiance towards templars or mages which offers separate missions, and character quests to please specific characters, often for romantic purposes. Each main mission has a recommended level to start and there are multiple difficulty levels. For combat the game can be played as an action RPG, controlling one character while the AI handles the other three, or using a more tactical approach. In the tactical mode the game is paused and orders can be issued. There are also many more details for enemies shown then, such as the HP, strengths and weaknesses. By holding a button the action can be started and as soon as it is released the game pauses again. Even when approaching it an an action RPG you still define the abilities of the other party members through skill trees and you can guide their general approach, such as aggressive or rather relying on defense. Weapon and equipment management through an inventory is also present as well as crafting based on recipes.<br><br>Multiplayer is available for up to four players, working cooperatively with quests separate from the single-player game, a first for the series. It is linked through the single-player game setting as the party members act as agents for the Inquisition. Also entirely new to the series is the introduction of optional micropayments to speed up progress, through the acquisition of the Platinum currency. Unlocked or crafted items cannot be transferred between the two game modes.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows 7<br/>Processor: Quad core 2.0 Ghz</>RAM: 4 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 26 GB<br/>Video: GeForce 8800GT or HD4870<br/>Sound: Yes';

	des := '<i>Anno 2070</i> is an economy centred build-up strategy game that blends city buildings with resource management and diplomacy. It is the first game in the series to take place in the future instead of a historical setting in the past. The player has to harvest resources by placing a set of buildings (production chains) that will supply the town with goods needed by the population. Fulfilling the populations demands leads to them advancing to a higher level and unlocking more building options. The game is set in a semi-realistic future setting where the polar caps have melted and the sea levels have risen. The known structures of national states seem to have crumbled, however the game does not offer a specific explanation about the past.<br><br>Each game starts with a game world consisting of islands, that can be colonized or tapped for resources. Two main factions are competing with each other, and the player has to choose one to start with, though eventually ending up with the possibility to build the buildings of both factions.While game''s core elements stay the same, the "Global Trust" faction, also called "Tycoons" offers a rather industrial approach, making use of polluting factories and old fashioned technology, where the "Eden Initiative" steers into a more ecological direction, offering the player to use buildings like "weather control stations" or "Ozone Makers" to influence the eco-balance of his islands.<br><br>The eco-balance is represented numerically and changing it changes the game-world visually, meaning a polluted island will be foggy while a clean island will appear bright and shiny. Furthermore gameplay is bound to the eco-balance, which means that polluted islands will suffer decreased productivity in agricultural areas and island inhabitants will be unhappy, resulting in less tax pay. At a later stage the player has the optional possibility to unlock a third faction, which is called "S.A.A.T.", or generally "The Techs" which enables to dive below the oceans surface and build production facilities on underwater plateaus. This faction also offers ways to produce items that increase the efficiency of different aspects of the game, like researching damage bonuses for your ships or items that reduce the upkeep cost of the production yards. Furthermore the Tech faction will grant access to some air units and submarines, while the main factions only offer battleships for sea combat.<br><br>Several AI players are available that can be traded with, or battled. Each AI comes with a set of diplomacy options, like requesting a supporting fleet or requesting a quest to solve. Quests consist of small tasks that could be an escort of a trade ship or picking up crates from a certain spot on the ocean. While military, diplomacy and quests are short term diverting options, the main focus of the game clearly is in the management of goods, creating transport routes between islands and building a city.<br><br>The game also offers a campaign that tells a story about an artificial intelligence going mad. Generally speaking, the campaign acts more like a tutorial, where only the last of three chapters can be called challenging. It introduces the game to the player and explains the mentality of Global Trust, the Eden Initiative and S.A.A.T.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows XP<br/>Processor: Core 2 Duo 2.0 Ghz</>RAM: 2 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 5 GB<br/>Video: GeForce 8600GT or X1950Pro<br/>Sound: Yes';

	des := '<i>Battlefield 4</i> is a military first-person shooter set in the near future and basically a direct continuation of Battlefield 3. Like all games in the series, the focus is on its multiplayer mode in which player either take the role of an assault (front soldiers with medic abilities), recon (snipers), support (front soldiers who can give out ammo) or engineers (explosives experts). All classes have special abilities and gadgets which can be unlocked over time. In a variety of mostly team-based playing variants - most importantly conquest in which certain points on the maps have to be held by the own team and the faster rush mode with an defending team and an attacking team which has to destroy certain points - players face each other on usually big maps with a variety of vehicles to use. <br><br>Of course this instalments features various small and big differences to its predecessors. The most important are the interactive "Levolution" elements which emphasize the destroyable areas; one of the unique selling points of the Frostbite engine: each map has one level element which significantly changes how the level looks and plays when destroyed. <i>Battlefield 4</i> also brings back two elements from previous instalments: naval warfare and the commander mode. The commander is an additional player who sees the level from an overhead map, gives orders to the team members and can assign missile strikes. In contrast to Battlefield 2, the commander is not an actual player character on the battlefield and therefore can''t be killed. New playing modes are Defuse (both teams have to detonate a bomb in a target zone, each player has only one "life" per round) and Obliteration (there spawns only one bomb pack on the map which has to be used to detonate three points on the map).<br><br>Like the predecessor, <i>Battlefield 4</i> features a singleplayer campaign. A Chinese general overthrows the government, starts a war with the whole world (but is allied with Russia) and the USA has to save the day. The player takes the role of a faceless soldier named Recker, as commander of a small troop he can assign basic orders, who has to survive several missions of the usual Call of Duty variety: linear levels with a lot of boom and hundreds of enemies to shoot. In comparison to <i>Battlefield 3</i>, some levels are a bit more and in some cases the player drives a vehicle. Of course there are also the usual stealth and torture sequences. There is no co-op mode anymore.<br><br>The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions only allow 24 instead of 64 players at a time and have therefore smaller multiplayer maps.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows 8 64-bit<br/>Processor: (AMD): Six-core CPU or (Intel): Quad-core CPU<br/>RAM: 8 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 30 GB<br/>Video: AMD Radeon HD 7870 or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 / 3 GB<br/>Sound: Yes';

	des := '<i>Fallout 4</i> is an open world role-playing game in the style of its predecessors, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. Returning gameplay features include the ability to switch between first-person and third-person perspectives, an open world with free roam exploration, a variety of combat options (including guns, explosives, unarmed, and melee), numerous sidequests along with a more linear main questline that branches toward its conclusion, dialogue options that influence the route of a conversation, and the selection of companions that aid in battle. <br><br>The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skill system also makes a return, allowing the player to decide the importance of certain skills to their character (S.P.E.C.I.A.L. being an acronym for Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck) upon leveling up. The function of perks is altered, as they are now attached to a skill tree with availability dependent on the rank of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skills that they''re associated with. The Intense Training perk is replaced by the optional ability to improve the rank of any one of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skills by leveling up, in the place of selecting a perk. The Pip-Boy can be acquired early on, and provides access to the player''s statistics, inventory, maps, and quest information as in previous games, with the added function of playing mini-games that can be found throughout the Commonwealth. The player can also make use of the Pip-Boy app in order to access the Pip-Boy menu, rather than using the in-game function. HP (health points) and AP (action points) make a return as primary statistics, with the removal of weapon and armor condition. Stimpaks, beds, and other types of consumables such as water or TV dinners can be used to restore HP. Unlike in previous games, exposure to radiation directly influences the player''s max health, and can only be reduced through RadAway or paid assistance from a doctor. AP restores over time, and can be used to sprint or attack using the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.), slowing down time and giving the player the ability to select a target with success in combat dependent on accuracy, which itself is dependent on factors such as weapon range, distance of the target, and obstruction of the target. <br><br>New features include the absence of a level cap, allowing the player to completely max their skills and acquire all perks, fully-voiced male and female protagonists, and an expansive crafting system. The player can cook food, craft drugs, add a wide variety of modifications to weapons and armor, and construct functioning settlements. Settlements may be provided with food, purified water, power, defense systems, housing, and shops that attract merchants and settlers. The player can obtain materials for building by collecting objects that may be deconstructed throughout the wasteland (classified in the Pip-Boy as "junk") or deconstructing unneeded objects, such as collapsed houses or fallen trees, all of which can be placed in the workshop for later use.<br><br>The story of <i>Fallout 4</i> begins in 2077, in an alternate retro-futuristic timeline that diverged from that of the real world following World War II. In favor of miniaturization of electronics, the world''s governments have focused on developing nuclear energy as a power source, which has led to the creation of power armor, laser weaponry, and housekeeping robots. However, despite these technological advancements, the world is in a state of crisis, as resources are scarce and nuclear war is imminent. During this time, the customizable player character lives a peaceful life in a suburban neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts with their spouse and infant son. However, the peace is interrupted when a Vault-Tec representative knocks on the family''s door. The man informs the player character that their family has recently been approved for entry into the nearby Vault 111, one of many vaults constructed by Vault-Tec as shelter against the threats of a nuclear holocaust. This visit is closely followed by a news report of a nuclear attack, giving the family no other choice but to take shelter in Vault 111, where they are tricked into a state of cryosleep. 210 years later, in the year 2287, the player character emerges from the vault, beginning their journey into a post-apocalyptic wasteland.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows 7/8/10 (64-bit OS required)<br/>Processor: Intel Core i5-2300 2.8 GHz/AMD Phenom II X4 945 3.0 GHz or equivalent<br/>RAM: 8 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 30 GB<br/>Video: NVIDIA GTX 550 Ti 2GB/AMD Radeon HD 7870 2GB or equivalent<br/>Sound: DirectX compatible Soundcard';

	des := '<i>Mass Effect</i> is the first part of a science fiction RPG trilogy. It is set in a futuristic universe created specifically for the game, with its own history, various alien races, as well as cultural, political, and social background.<br><br>The story of the game deals with Commander Shepard, supposedly the first human candidate for the elite group of special agents (the Spectres), who serve the inter-galactic Council, comprised of the oldest and most powerful races in the universe. With or without the help of the Council, Shepard has to stop Saren, a Spectre member who went rogue and tries to exact revenge upon those he was once a part of.<br><br>In <i>Mass Effect</i> the player takes control of Commander Shepard, who is fully customizable in the character creation screen; his abilities, gender, and physical appearance can be shaped by the player. Both female and male versions of the character are fully voiced.<br><br>Combat in the game is action-based, and is similar to tactical squad-based shooters. As in most of  BioWare''s previous RPGs, the player can pause at any time to issue orders to other squad members. The squad members are AI-dependable, but general commands (such as run forward, take cover, target a specific enemy, etc) can be issued without pausing.<br><br>The six character classes in the game are Soldier, Engineer, Adept, Infiltrator, Sentinel, and Vanguard. Soldiers are good with weapons, Engineers can use tech abilities to sabotage enemies'' equipment, and Adepts are able to use the disruptive biotic powers. The other three classes are combinations of the first three. Character growth features, beside the usual "level up" system, a skill-based advancement. When the characters gain a level, the player is allowed to distribute points into skills of his/her choice. These skills include weapon proficiency, tech abilities such as destroying enemy shields or hacking robotic enemies, and biotic abilities that manipulate the mass effect field to damage enemies and protect the party. Non-combat abilities for the main character include Charm and Intimidate, which influences conversation choices.<br><br><i>Mass Effect</i> comes with its own morality system. There are two sides of morality in the game - Paragon and Renegade, with Paragon being a more diplomatic, official military courtesy following character, and Renegade being the "ends justify the means", damning everything to hell kind of character. The main quest with its choices and consequences is only a part of the experience - there are several optional planets that offer side-questing and exploration. Pursuing a romantic relationship with a companion is also possible.<br><br>The game introduces a slightly tweaked conversation system in which responses to NPC''s are displayed and can be chosen before the NPC has finished speaking. This, combined with detailed facial expressions, allows for more fluid and natural conversations.<br><br>The PC version of <i>Mass Effect</i> differs in some points from the Xbox 360 release. Besides higher resolution graphics, the mini game about hacking a computer has been changed. Now instead of playing "Simon Says", the player has to get a triangle into the middle of a circle by avoiding the blocks that are constantly moving around in a Frogger-like fashion. The interface has also undergone massive changes. Besides a new quick slot bar in which the player can assign up to eight abilities for quick access to the number keys, the pause menu has been changed to give the player faster and better control over his teammates. It''s now also possible to give every teammate individual orders instead of having both do the same thing. Item management has also been simplified to account for the new keyboard/mouse control scheme which also allows for better precision in the shooter-like fights.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows XP / Vista / 7<br/>Processor: 2.4+ GHz Intel or 2.0+ GHz AMD<br/>RAM: 1GB RAM (XP)/2GB Ram (Vista)<br/>Hard Drive: 12 GB<br/>Video: N/A<br/>Sound: Sound card required';

Deep inside the fortress of Icecrown, he then sat on his throne in quiet meditation and the people slowly began to forget the threat that was waiting on the third continent of Azeroth called Northend. But the quiet times are over as the Lich King is now awake again and sends his Scourge armies out to every corner of Azeroth. At the same time the blue Dragon Aspect called Malygos also emerged from his long seclusion and launches a merciless war against mortal practitioners of arcane magic. Now both the Horde and the Alliance amass their armies and make their move into Northend in the hopes of keeping the threat in check and perhaps even finally destroy it.<br><br>Besides the whole new continent of Northrend with new zones, enemies, factions, instances and hundreds of quests, the second add-on to World of Warcraft also adds the first hero class to the game: the Death Knight. A Death Knight can be created on every server the player already has a level 55+ character on, can be of any race and is very powerful because he can do almost everything except for carrying shields or using ranged weapons. Once the player has created a Death Knight, he begins his life at level 55 in an instanced area on a necrophyle under the watchful eye of the Lich King himself. During the following quest line, the player will not only learn how to enchant his sword by using runecrafting, he will also slowly become disgusted with the ways of the Lich King and in the end desert him to enter the normal world of Azeroth and Outland and join up with the Alliance or Horde in the fight against the Lich King.<br><br>The expansion also expands the level cap to 80. In correspondence with that new talents are available for each class to invest the 10 additional points in and many trees were rebalanced to accompany the new talents. Another addition is the new profession called "Inscription". People of that profession can produce Glyphs that are not applied to an item but instead alter the effects and/or requirements of spells and abilities of their carrier. A druid can for example use a glyph to increase the duration of his "Thorns"-buff from 10 minutes to 60 minutes or decrease the amount of mana required to cast "Gift of the Wild".<br><br>Other new features are new pvp battlegrounds and arenas, the addition of Barbershops, which allow the players to change their appearance after character creation in exchange for gold, an Achievements-system and an in-game calendar.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows XP (Service Pack 3), Windows Vista (Service Pack 1)<br/>Processor: Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz or AMD Athlon XP 1500+<br/>RAM: 512 MB (1 GB for Vista)<br/>Hard Drive: 12GB Available Space<br/>Video: ATI Radeon 7200 or Better<br/>Sound: DirectX-compatible sound card';

	des := '<i>Grand Theft Auto V</i> takes place five years after Grand Theft Auto IV and is now set in Los Santos. It centers around three protagonists: Michael, Trevor and Franklin. New to the series is that the player can switch between the three characters on the fly. They each have different missions, lives and personalities. They also often come together, especially for heists, a complex type of mission where a large operation needs to be planned and executed by determining a strategy and hiring additional henchmen. As with previous games in the series, the gameplay involves gunfights and takes place in a sprawling, open world city where players get around by acquiring transport (cars, boats, helicopters, etc) through less than legal means. Players can roam the game world, complete story missions and partake in various illegal activities, including shooting civilians, robbing people, destruction of cars and the titular act of car theft. These lead to a wanted rating of up to five stars, sending in a police force in pursuit. Continuing to resist the police will also increase it. The wanted status is lost by getting out of sight or by spraying the car.<br><br>Michael, whilst hiding in the witness protection program as a result of a botched robbery nine years earlier, encounters Franklin who, in his capacity as a repo man, is sent to get a car from Michael''s son Jimmy. Michael however realises Franklin is being set up, so tells Franklin to crash his sons car into the dealership who sent him. After that, they become friends. One day, Michael discovers his wife in bed with another man, and with Franklin''s help, chases him to a mansion, which they promptly burn to the ground. The mansion, unfortunately, belongs to Mexican drug lord Martin Madrazo, who demands they compensate him for what they did. They successfully rob a jewelry store, and one of Michael''s old partners Trevor hears of this, and asks to team up with the other two, who agree. From here their lives begin to spiral out of control.<br><br>The game''s multiplayer component is called <i>GTA Online</i>. It is set two months before the start of the single-player story. It allows up to 16 players (PS3 / Xbox 360) or 30 players (Xbox One / PS4 / PC) to travel around a world identical to the single-player world to complete story-driven activities, both competitive and co-operative.<br><br>The later released PS4, Xbox One and PC versions have various enhancements and additional features. Technical upgrades include an increased draw distance and support for higher resolutions. New content includes new weapons, vehicles and activities, additional wildlife, denser traffic, a new foliage system, enhanced damage and weather effects. The Dodo is a classic <i>GTA</i> seaplane, there are stock car races with additional liveries, a new Imponte Duke O''Death vehicle, the Marshall Monster Truck, and the Xero Blimp. There are new shooting challenges and new weapons such as the rail gun and hatchet. New wildlife photo challenges let players unlock the Kraken submarine. A new murder mystery can be solved to unlock film noir game filters. Monkey Mosaics are a new collectible to unlock monkey outfits and Monkey Blista. There are also 100 additional songs divided over the 17 existing radio stations. The most distinct new feature is a full first-person view for the entire game, allowing the player to shoot, walk and drive from that perspective. This comes with entirely new animations for the view, showing the hands when entering cars or in melee fights, and vehicles have fully functional interiors, HUDs and interfaces.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows 7 64 bits<br/>Processor: Q6600<br/>RAM: 4 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 65 GB<br/>Video: GeForce 9800GT or Radeon 4870<br/>Sound: Yes';

He was working on a secret weapon codenamed Aurora. But before the commandos could escape the island, Japan activated Aurora and killed everyone.<br><br><i>Battlefield: Bad Company 2</i> takes place in the present day after the events in Battlefield: Bad Company. The four members of B-Company, better known as Bad Company, Privates Preston Marlowe, Terrence Sweetwater, George Haggard, and Sergeant Samuel Redford are sent behind Russian enemy lines to secure a device related to Aurora. But although they managed to escape Russian soldiers and completed their supposedly final mission, the device turns out to be a fake. Consequently Army General Braidwood assigns them to a special operation of stopping Aurora.<br><br>The fairly linear single player campaign puts the player into the shoes of Private Preston Marlowe, sending him off to uncover the mysteries surrounding Aurora in a typical first-person-shooter-fashion. On the side of the other members of Bad Company, the player tries to fulfill the various objectives of the missions while gunning down several dozens enemies using a huge arsenal of real-world military equipment but limited to only carrying two main weapons and a side-arm at the same time. During the course of the game, the player unlocks new weapons by finding them during his missions, granting him the ability to equip them from then on at every supply drop.<br><br>As in previous installments of the Battlefield series, the core of the game is again the class-based and team-based multiplayer for up to 32 players, divided into squads with four men each. Four game modes are available: Rush, Conquest, Squad-Rush and Squad-Deathmatch. Each mode can also be played on "Hardcore"-difficulty, deactivating the cross-hair, the mini-map and such. The four modes in detail:<ul><li>Rush requires the two teams, Russians and Americans, to either defend or destroy mobile transmitters. Once the attacking team successfully destroys one, the battlefield is expanded and the fight moves on to the next transmitter.</li><li>Conquest is once again all about capturing and holding flags.</li><li>Squad-Rush has two squads fighting for two mobile transmitters at the same time.</li><li>Squad-Deathmatch pits squads against each other with the winner being the squad that scores the most kills.</li></ul> The available classes are Assault, Engineer, Medic and Recon. Each class has their own set of weapons and gadgets. While the Engineer has his repair torch to repair tanks and other machinery, the Medic uses his Defibrillator to revive fallen team members and prevent the loss of a ticket. Each class gets access to new weapons and equipment by leveling up. The players get experience points for killing people, capturing flags, fulfilling objectives and earning achievements like killing 7 enemies in one round with a light machine gun. Additional points are gained, if the player interacts with one of his current squad-mates. With these experience points, the player levels both up his class to unlock new stuff as well as his overall rank.<br><br>Although the game is very infantry-heavy, vehicles like bikes, tanks or helicopters stand ready to be used in the fight. Tanks are especially useful to take full advantage of the so-called Destruction 2.0 system, which allow the players to take down whole buildings if enough fire power is used. The health system is a mix of using med-packs and automatic healing. If a player still dies and isn''t resurrected by a Medic, he can either choose to respawn at a stationary points like the home base or captured flags, or use one of his squad-mates as an entry point.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows XP<br/>Processor: Core 2 Duo 2.0 Ghz</>RAM: 2 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 15 GB<br/>Video: GeForce 7800GT or X1900<br/>Sound: Yes';

	des := '<i>Battlefield 1</i> is the fifteenth main game in the <i>Battlefield</i> shooter franchise and as a main entry the follow-up to the 2013 Battlefield 4. This time it is set during World War I and it is inspired by the historic events. Like most of the main games in the series it combines a single-player campaign with an extensive amount of multiplayer modes. The campaign consists of six large missions, dubbed War Stories, each with a different protagonist, a different setting and distinct gameplay elements. The prologue "Storm of Steel" is experienced through the eyes of several Harlem Hellfighters in France and "Through Mud and Blood" is about controlling a tank in France as a British driver. "Friends in High Places" takes it to the skies in France and England as a fighter pilot for the Royal Flying Corp and in "Avanti Savoia" you are a member of the Arditi in Italy. In "The Runner" you are an ANZAC runner in Turkey and the final story "Nothing is Written" is about controlling a Bedouin warrior commanded by Lawrence of Arabia in Mesopotamia. Each story has a different approach and offers specific vehicles, weapons or play styles.<br><br>Multiplayer usually supports 24, 32 or 64 players on a single map depending on the game mode and most of these are based on the settings of the single-player War Stories. The game was launched with nine multiplayer maps: Amiens, Argonne Forest, Ballroom Blitz, Empire''s Edge, Fao Fortress, Monte Grappa, Sinai Desert, St. Quentin Scar, and Suez. There are seven game modes: Air Superiority, Conquest, Domination, Operations, Rush, Team Deathmatch, and War Pigeons. Rush, Conquest, Team Deathmatch, and Domination all return from <i>Battlefield 4</i>. Air Superiority was introduced in Battlefield 3: End Game.<br><br>War Pigeons is a team based mode where up to 24 players need to work together to locate pigeons. Once captured, a pigeon needs to be held and defended by the team, while the other team attempts to kill that player. While it is held, a message is being written and once completed the pigeon is released and the message provides the location of the enemy forces for the friendly artillery to rain down on them. The team then receives a point. Pigeon progress is sustained when it is dropped. It can also be shot when it is released and in the air, denying the point and artillery. The message is written the quickest by standing still; shooting and moving slows down the writing.<br><br>The Operations game mode builds on the concept of Rush with offence and defense. The map is split up in sectors the offensive side needs to secure. When both control points of a sector are captured, they own the sector. This goes on for several sectors until a final one is captured, but the attackers have limited respawns. The main difference is that the game takes place across several maps and the back-and-forth is turned into a large military campaign where one environment continues where the previous one ended. Attackers only have three waves to capture all maps to win the entire match. The limited respawns can be countered by using medics and the attackers receive special vehicles that allow for a big push forward. Every map has a specific type: Airship L30 (zeppelin), Armored Train, or Dreadnought (naval vessel).<br><br>Multiplayer has eight distinct classes: Assault, Cavalry, Elite, Medic, Pilot, Scout, Support, and Tanker. A new element is the introduction of a persistent squad where a team of up to five players can remain together as a single unit, even when moving between different servers. Warbonds is the in-game currency used to buy items and gear. There are many authentic weapons such as artillery, flamethrowers, hand guns and small arms, machine guns, many types of rifles, shotguns and mustard gas. Gas can countered by wearing a mask, but this limits both hearing and viewing. Weapons have many types of customization options. There is also a large amount of melee weapons divided in two groups to support the trench based combat including bayonets, clubs, sabres and shovels. Armed vehicles include aircraft, battleships tanks, trucks, and zeppelin. It is also possible to ride a horse into battle.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows 7 64 bits<br/>Processor: FX6350 or i5 6600k<br/>RAM: 8 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 50 GB<br/>Video: GeForce GTX 660 or Radeon 7850<br/>Sound: Yes';

	des := '<i>RIFT</i> is a 3D MMORPG set in the fantasy world Telara and requires a monthly subscription to play next to the initial purchase. The player can choose from different shards (servers) with the same quests and content, but with slightly different rules: Player vs. Environment (attacking other players is restricted to faction clashes and warfronts), Player vs. Player (other players can be attacked anywhere in the world), and Roleplaying (subset of PvE and PvP shards with a focus on remaining in character and stricter naming rules). Characters created by the player are bound to a specific shard. When creating a new character, the player chooses between two factions (Guardian or Defiant), with three races each; Mathosian, High Elf and Dwarf for Guardian, and Eth, Kelari and Bahmi for Defiant. Next to the character appearance, the character can further be defined through a Calling, which influences gameplay mechanics: Warrior, Cleric, Rogue, or Mage. The starting equipment can also be selected.<br><br>Telara is surrounded by a large barrier known as the Ward. It was created by mages and native gods to hold back the gods of the six elemental planes (Life, Death, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth) when they attempted to invade Telara. Lately however, massive rifts have appeared. These are cracks in the barrier that allow monsters of the elemental planes to invade Telara. They are after Telara''s large deposits of sourcestone, an important resource, and attempt to conquer part of the lands. The main story focus of the game is on closing these rifts. The spawn location of these rifts is dynamic and the players can attempt to tackle them alone or in groups. Rifts of opposing elemental planes will also attempt to thwart each other. The two factions have a different approach to saving Telara. Guardians are resurrected by the gods from a past life to defend the world, while Defiants are sent back through machines from a future where the dragons were victorious. Players are urged to work together on closing the rifts, as they can affect the environment permanently. When the monsters establish a foothold, the attacks evolve into a full-fledged invasion and finally total war. While the rifts are open, all regular quests get more dangerous and save cities get overrun. That way, players all need to chip in to return the regular order, or live with the increased difficulty. Each player can contribute in some way, regardless of their level.<br><br>An important part of character building is done through Souls. These are spirits of legendary figures from Telara''s past and come with a specific fighting style, healing and spells. Earned points can be invested into a specific ability of a soul, choosing the defensive abilities of one soul and the healing of another for instance. The chosen investments can afterwards be rearranged and saved as separate configurations (roles) to adapt quickly to a different situation. The player can only bond with souls that match their chosen Calling and these provide an unique Soul skill tree. Each Calling has eight possible soul paths. To progress, the player needs to invest soul points into a specific path and these points are provided through levelling. The soul tree has two options for levelling; either branches (specific abilities or bonuses) or roots (base abilities). Roots are generally unlocked after investing in specific branches.<br><br>The GUI is typical for an MMORPG. It shows the character from a third-person perspective, along with standard elements such as a character display, panel buttons, a chat window, an action and inventory bar, quest stickies, a mini-map, and icons for buff and debuff. Character statistics are defined through 20 categories such as strength, intelligence, valor, block, and attack power. Specific perks and quests only become available through a separate guild panel. Players can group into raids, from six to twenty people, and appoint a leader. The player also has access to pets, companions and mounts, and there is a separate skill to craft items through recipes. Items can be sold through auctions or traded with another player. Quests are generally provided through NPCs or objects with a green exclamation mark.<br><br>Next to the basic story, players can access Warfronts through a separate panel. These are instances of Player vs. Player combat based on four game modes: Martyrdom (hold an item as long as possible, but you receive damage while it is in your possession), Capture the Flag, Domination, and Conquest.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows XP, Vista or 7<br/>Processor: Dual Core 2.0 GHz or better<br/>RAM: 2 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 15.0 GB available<br/>Video: Nvidia GeForce FX 5900, ATI/AMD Radeon X300, Intel GMA X4500 or better.<br/>Sound: DirectX 8.1 compliant card';

Gentlemen on the other hand now inspire the people in their home territory or increase the change of riots in enemy territory. In addition each character is now able to spy on nearby enemies, although spies will still be able to get better and faster results.</li><li><b>Recruitment of Military Characters</b> - Admirals and Generals are recruited out of a pool, giving the player an assortment of characters with different skills and abilities. Every four rounds new characters are added and the better they are, the more they cost.</li><li><b>Improved Diplomacy-Options</b> - The diplomacy-screen now offers additional options like the ability to convince a new ally to join a raging war or requesting a trade-embargo against a third nation.</li><li><b>Skills of Generals</b> - In addition to raising the moral of their troops, Generals now also posses special skills to directly motivate a specific unit on the battlefield and are able to reunite fleeing units.</li><li><b>Ship-repairs</b> - Ships can now be repaired even during the battle which are of course risky and will suspend every other action the ship is taking at that moment.</li><li><b>Multiplayer-Campaigns</b> - Napoleon''s campaign can be played with human players.</li><li><b>Drop-in-Battles</b> - Allows the player to battle against human players during the single player campaign.

However, we weren''t told that there was at least one person who survived the onslaught: a human named Hawke. Having become a refugee, Hawke travels to an area known as the Free Marches - more specifically, the city of Kirkwall. Hawke''s family shares the fate with many other Ferelden refugees; the authorities of Kirkwall are suspicious of the newcomers, and the path to financial stability is anything but easy. Meanwhile, the appearance of the mysterious race of Qunari heralds more trouble to the inhabitants of Kirkwall, as does the growing tension between the Templars and the mages. Hawke is caught in the middle of these political and social conflicts - what shall be the hero''s own path?..<br><br><i>Dragon Age II</i> uses a "framed narrative" format: the story is narrated over a decade later by one of Hawke''s companions. Similarly to  Alpha Protocol, the narrative is rather flexible; motivations and events vary depending on the player''s moral choices during the game. The game also adopts the "wheel-based" dialogue system from Mass Effect games: short responses that reflect different tones and attitudes the player wishes to choose for Hawke. Also similarly to <i>Mass Effect</i>, the main character''s race and name cannot be changed; however, everything else (appearance, gender, classes) can be freely customized.<br><br>The combat system is quite similar to the one used in the previous <i>Dragon Age</i> game (which, in its turn, dates back to the combat style used in  Baldur''s Gate), though it has been noticeably sped up. Hawke can only be human, but the player can customize his or her physical appearance and character class (warrior, mage, or rogue). The player controls Hawke and up to three active party members, either "programming" their actions by assigning actions that should be taken under certain conditions (for example, healing a party member if his HP drops below 20%), or issuing commands to each character manually. The ability tree is also similar, the player being able to learn new abilities as the characters level up. Many abilities from the first game return, but some are absent or replaced with new ones. The abilities are divided into various disciplines, which correspond to the fighting style of the character.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows XP/Vista<br/>Processor: 2 GHz Core 2 Duo 1.8 Ghz<br/>RAM: 1 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 7 GB<br/>Video: GeForce 7900GS or Radeon  2600Pro<br/>Sound: Yes';

The mechanics of <i>Mario Kart</i> have evolved allowing the race karts to transform in the middle of a race between a hang glider and a hydro submersible vehicle upon encountering aerial of underwater course segments respectively.

In addition to traditional controls, <i>Mario Kart 7</i> can be played using the Nintendo 3DS gyroscope, in which the action is viewed in first person and the player steers the kart simply by turning the entire game system.

When the time is up, players then fight against each other with their upgraded characters. Returning from previous entries is the All Star mode, where the player must defeat all other characters in the game in order, with only limited healing items available.

There is also the gyroscopic technology which allows the player to aim by moving the system, this makes it easier to use weapons like boomerangs and slingshots. The game also contains the Master Quest version and a new "boss challenge" mode. For the newcomers there is also a feature called "visions" that show the player how to complete certain tasks.<br><br>Story-wise the game has remained the same: Link is a young boy who lives in the Kokiri Forest, but is one day called to arms by the Deku Tree who tells him to leave the forest and find Princess Zelda. Link is told that he must stop the evil Ganondorf from taking over Hyrule. The game still has the same puzzles and the only change is that the Stone of Agony has been replaced by a "Shard of Agony" which does the same thing. The Master Quest is a version of the game with a mirrored world, new puzzles and stronger enemies, but was already released on the Nintendo Gamecube.';

These quests are categorized into three categories: hunting, gathering, and capturing quests.

Players prepare for hunts by gathering herbs, honey, and other items in the single player mode, where they then use these items for a competitive advantage in the online multiplayer mode where they team up with up to four other players to defeat monsters. Defeating monsters can be done in three ways: killing, capturing or causing them to flee. Quests require defeating monsters in one of these three ways. Killing monsters grants a carved off piece of the monster, which can be given to a blacksmith in order to make different weapons.  <br><br>The game features a single-player offline mode and a multiplayer online mode. The bulk of the game is in the online mode, which is where most of the monster killing takes place.

	des := '<i>Code of Princess</i> is a side-scrolling hack-n-slash RPG from the director of Guardian Heroes.  As Tetsuhiko Kikuchi''s influence is heavy here, the game is, in some ways, like a spiritual successor to the aforementioned Saturn title.<br><br><i>Code of Princess</i> follows a typically "anime" plot about a princess whose kingdom is being overrun by monsters, and a motley crew of characters that meet and join together to overthrow the evil monsters and the reason the monsters are there.  Primary focus is on the character Solange as she wields a massive sword known as the deLuxcalibur, which is a sacred artifact of sorts for her kingdom.  She is joined by several other characters, most of whom are playable in the story mode of the game.<br><br>Each stage is a fairly straight-forward side-scrolling affair more focused on intense combat than any amount of exploration. Each character uses the same basic controls, but all are played very differently.  Many combat moves are performed in a style similar to a fighting game, such as pressing down, towards, and the A or B button.  Players may typically move between 2-4 planes of action on the stage moving forward or back in the 3D space, and doing so is often part of the strategy of moving through levels.  Typically, a note at the top of the screen will give the current objective for the level or individual wave during the level, such as "defeat all enemies," "defeat the boss" (which makes the other enemies more of a distraction), "save a villager," or even simply to survive for a set period of time.  <br><br>Since levels and missions tend not be be very long they are very numerous and players will find themselves leveling up frequently.  Each level allows the player to assign skill points (generally 5 points) to any of six attributes:  Vitality (life), Piety (maximum magic), Attack, Defense, Mind (magic strength), and Speed.  Various status effects may affect the player throughout the game as well including burning, shock, stone, dark (draining magic), or poison.  <br><br>Each main story character not only plays differently, but they level up independently of one another, so that players may choose customize each character differently.  For instance, Solange is naturally a bit slow, but fairly powerful, so a player may build on these strengths adding new speed and ramping up her strength even more.  The character Ali is already pretty fast, so players may want to customize based on that, while other characters are more magic-based, or various combinations of strength, magic, speed, etc.<br><br>Besides the regular story missions, there is a Free Play mode that allows players to replay any story mission without lengthy cut scenes or dialog, and there are Bonus missions which unlock parallel to the Story.  Often, they operate as elements to deepen the overall story experience through the gameplay, or simply to add new twists that aren''t part of the main story, such as fighting a boss a second time after the boss has, essentially received a "second wind" and called in some support.  Bonus Missions also tend to be more challenging, with many of them greatly exceeding the difficulty of the regular story missions, leaving these to be "pro" challenges or challenges for those players willing to replay missions enough to level up several times more.<br><br>During combat, players may lock-on to a single enemy, which allows the player to deal heavier damage to said enemy.  On top of this, activating a Burst gradually drains the magic meter, but also increases all attacks on every enemy.  Combining this with a lock-on allows a player to deal massive damage with every attack.  There is also a shop where players may buy better weapons, armor, and the like--though it is fairly small compared to a traditional RPG.<br><br>Finally, the game also uses the Nintendo Network for local and online co-op and versus play, complete with leaderboards.  This mode also allows players to use more than just the main eight main protagonist characters--practically every single enemy character in the game can be unlocked to be used in this mode, from the simplest soldier characters to massive dragons and even boss characters.

The Android version has additional venues exclusive to the platform: Detroit, Hong Kong and Rio de Janeiro. At the start a limited amount of vehicles is available (Abarth 500 SS, DeLorean DMC-12, MINI John Cooper Works and Nissan Nizmo 370Z) and additional ones, including motorcycles, are unlocked by completing events.

Tapping the left side of the screen activates braking and tapping the right side activates boost. Drifting is done by tapping the brake while turning and another tap stops the drift. Successful races usually require mastering drifts, ramming rivals and using short-cuts. Multiplayer is available locally through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and online multiplayer is supported as well.';

The hookshot, hammer, ice rod, and many other items are rentable and purchasable from there from the beginning of Link''s adventure: rentals cost little, yet the item is lost if Link happens to die; purchases cost more, yet grant permanent possession, and the possibility to give the item one upgrade.

This will require constant training of new moves which will become available over time as you acquire them. After you teach the bunny new moves, you will be able to instruct it to use those moves during the theatrical performances. Theatrical performances consist of a director telling you what the story is about and what he wants to see in each scene, and you will have to instruct bunny to act accordingly, providing you have taught it the moves necessary to perform the full play.<li> Robot - after you acquire a toy robot from one of the street vendors, you will be able to play levels that will become gradually available. Levels are rectangular in shape and you can move your robot left, right, up or down through the field of squares. Each movement uses some of the battery and you have to reach the end square before the battery depletes which still gives you a lot of time for trial and error. Single movement will move your robot by three steps unless it bumps into a wall or picks up some special items that may temporarily boost its power to eat through the wall and enemies that move in pre-defined patterns.<li> Shop - helping the friend in need, as a true gentleman, this mini-game will let you order the items in the store so that when customer comes to buy what he or she wants, the rest of the items also catch his/her eye and in turn you end up selling all your wares. Base item is initially set in the store, and you can place other items only adjacent to already placed items in the store. What will catch the eye of the customer after purchasing some item is the adjacent item that is either of the same type or of the same color. Placing two similar items might confuse the customer due to ambiguity which may lead the customer to stop buying after a while if the net remaining adjacent item has no connection to the last item he or she purchased.</ul>Beside mini-games there are many collectible items you can find during your exploration and some of the flashback sub-stories become available after certain key events which can then be watched as short episodes where characters vary from event to event, and might not even be one of the leading three characters.';

This test will not be so easy as the two must venture together into seven Sleeping Worlds and find the the Keyholes of Sleep to awaken them.

Sora learns from a letter he receives from King Mickey that he is the only one who can save those lost who are connected to him; referring to the characters Ventus, Aqua, and Terra from Birth by Sleep.  Sora and Riku travel to worlds based on settings from various Disney properties such as La Cité des Cloches (The Hunchback of Notre Dame), Prankster''s Paradise (Pinnochio), Symphony of Sorcery (Fantasia) and The Grid (Tron).  <br><br>The game utilizes a gameplay mechanic called Flowmotion which allows your character to quickly bounce off walls and scale buildings in short bursts of speed.

It has several features from both simulator-style racing games (e.g. NASCAR 09) and from arcade racing games (such as Burnout). Authentic NASCAR tracks are present in the game, but most "break out" from the track and into the surrounding city area, hence the "Unleashed" aspect. Pit lanes remain and are important for vehicle repairs and obtaining Slingshot boosts. A 15-driver "All-Stars" list of NASCAR drivers and their cars is present in the game, though all control identically. Drafting (lowering air resistance, and increasing speed by driving behind other cars) is also present.<br><br>Besides drifting and boosting, the game features wild arcade-infused physics which often see cars barrel-rolling through the air, and collisions are rampant.  Cars can be wrecked and players will routinely create Rivals, who become much more aggressive opponent racers.  Should the player be wrecked, he has the ability to perform a Payback wreck on the Rival.<br><br>The boost meter is filled through extremely aggressive driving, slamming other cars, wrecking other cars, drifting, and drafting. Filling the boost meter gives the player the ability to use a Slingshot boost to race quickly around opponents, and the time limit on a boost tends to depend on the skill of a player to maintain the car around obstacles, walls, and other cars.<br><br>Challenges routinely present themselves during each race. Completing challenges adds to the boost meter, and are occasionally part of secondary race challenges.  An in-race challenge may be as simple as reaching a certain position in the race or destroying obstacles on the tracks, or may require a bit more attention, such as creating Rivals or performing successful drifts.<br><br>The included game modes are:<ul><li><i>Championship</i> - The standard career mode with three tiers of difficulty where the player progresses through several races with the goal of finishing within a specific place such as placing in the top 12 or top 5.  Each track features two secondary challenges such as creating a set number of Rivals or performing a set number of Drifts.  Can be played by one or two players.</li><br><li><i>Quick Race</i> - Simple races that can be performed on any track, or in small, player-created career-style modes.  Only tracks unlocked in Championship mode can be used, and this mode can be played by one or two players.</li><br><li><i>Time Trials</i> - The standard, basic Time Trial mode of a typical racing game.

	des := '<i>Bravely Default</i> is a role-playing game that follows the adventures of four heroes in the world of Luxendarc, as they journey to find and awaken four elemental crystals: wind, water, fire, and earth. The party consists of Tiz Arrior, a young man whose village was destroyed by a Great Chasm; Agnès Oblige, the Wind Crystal vestal who seeks to awaken all four crystals at the urging of her cryst-fairy companion Airy; Ringabel, a devil-may-care cad with amnesia; and Edea Lee, a former Sky Knight who turned against her country and comrades in order to assist Agnès with her quest.<br><br>The game is considered a "traditional" Japanese RPG in that it sticks to classic mechanics such as accumulation of experience points, the equipping of weapons and armor, item usage, and turn-based combat. <i>Bravely Default</i> is heavily influenced by the Final Fantasy series, to the point where various spells and items are named identically to those in Final Fantasy (like Fire, Fira, and Firaga, or Phoenix Downs), and similar job classes. <i>Bravely Default</i> uses a job system where the characters are assigned a job class, and they earn "Job Points" in battle which go toward leveling up that character in that particular job. Each level brings with it new skills for the characters to use; the maximum job level is 14. Each job has a default ability assigned to the character while they hold that job; a secondary ability can also be selected from among the other jobs that have been unlocked. Skills can be equipped cross-job for each character as well. To unlock a job, the player must defeat an antagonist with that job class, either in the main story or through a side-quest.<br><br>Combat is, on the surface, a standard turn-based system where the player selects actions from a menu for each character and then each character acts in turn according to their speed stat. <i>Bravely Default</i> distinguishes itself via its use of "Brave Points" (BP), with at least one given to each character every turn. To act, the player must spend a BP for that character. Choosing "Default" from the battle menu lets the selected character bank a point, to be used in future turns or to be spent on actions that may require extra BP. Choosing "Brave" as an option allows the character to act more than once per turn, with a maximum of four actions allowed. The character need not have BP banked to use the "Brave" option; extra turns are essentially bought on credit, paid back by not having character act for that number of future turns. In battle a player may also activate "Bravely Second," which stops time and allows one character four actions (BP is not consumed). In order to use Bravely Second, the player needs "Sleep Points," which are earned by leaving the 3DS system in sleep mode with the game still running. The player earns one point for every six hours the system sleeps, for a maximum of three points stored.<br><br><i>Bravely Default</i> makes extensive use of the StreetPass functionality of the 3DS. Passing players are stored in the game, and can be summoned during battle to perform an action; the type and effectiveness of the action depends on how far the other player has gotten in the game, how much they''ve leveled up, the strength of their characters, and the skills they''ve learned. It does not cost anything to summon a friend, but that player cannot be summoned again until they have been tagged again via StreetPass. <i>Bravely Default</i> also features a mini-game to rebuild Tiz''s home village of Norende; StreetPass-tagged players are added to the village''s population and can be used to help rebuild the businesses in Norende. Rebuilt businesses will give the players free items occasionally. The town also comes under attack from monsters generated by StreetPass visitors; these monsters can be battled at any time and yield generous XP, JP, and items.<br><br>The Western versions of <i>Bravely Default</i> are localized from an updated version of the original release, with the update called <i>Bravely Default: For the Sequel</i> in Japan. This version features several enhancements to the original, such as more save slots, auto-battle, the ability to set the random encounter rate, improved interfaces, and a story event viewer.';

The story is told through fully voice-acted dialog during gameplay, with character art appearing on the lower screen.  <br><br>The basic gameplay is a shooter similar to Sin  || CHR(38) ||  Punishment: Star Successor, where players move Pit with the Circle Pad and target enemies with the touch-screen.  Firing shots is performed with the L button.  There is a lefty mode handled with the Circle Pad Pro, but no dual-analog/Circle Pad option.  Each stage is broken up into two segments:  An aerial segment with Pit flying to his destination, and a ground segment with Pit venturing towards a goal (typically with a boss) on foot.  Basic controls are largely the same for both segments with some exceptions.  On foot, players can swing the camera around by swiping the touch-screen, as well as access a variety of Powers.  During aerial segments, the camera is automatic and there are two Special Attack icons which are filled during combat.<br><br>Players have numerous Powers that can be obtained and used.  Powers are organized in a grid, and each power has a geometric shape associated with it.  More powerful abilities have larger or more elaborate shapes, and there is an element of Tetris to organizing the Powers in the grid.  These Powers run the gamut of inflicting poison damage, recovering health, jumping, effect recovery, alternate weapons (lasers, mines, etc), and several others.  Powers are typically discovered through regular gameplay and hidden among the ground-based segments of the stages.  Higher difficulties may yield higher quality Powers.  Players may save up to four different sets of Powers for solo gameplay.<br><br>Like Powers, weapons are also numerous and featured in a wide variety of categories.  There are nine types of weapons:  Staffs, Bows, Clubs, Orbitars, Blades, Claws, Palms, Cannons, and Arms.  While each weapon has both shooting and melee abilities, different weapon types yield different strengths and weaknesses to each ability.  Cannons and Orbitars, for instance, are great at long-range combat.  Clubs, Claws, and Arms on the other hand are superior melee weapons often with short distances in their shooting range, but yielding immense power in close-quarters.  Beyond the standard traits of the styles of weapons, each weapon also has a star rating evaluating their melee and ranged strengths, as well as an overall value giving an idea to how much overall power they yield.  There may be numerous types of a single weapon, and beyond category, melee rating, ranged rating, and value--weapons may also carry a variety of unique perks.  These perks range from raising total health, to minimizing the effects of certain attacks, to increasing speed.  Weapons are earned through online play, purchased, or discovered through regular gameplay hidden in chests or secret areas.  And finally, should a player be less than pleased with the weapons they''d obtained, there is always the option to fuse weapons together to create entirely new ones.<br><br>The main currency of the game is hearts, which are generally used for purchasing weapons.  Hearts are factored into the unique difficulty, referred to as "Intensity," settings of the game, which can be set from 0.0 to 9.9.  Players may "bet hearts" prior to starting a stage by setting higher Intensity settings.  Completing the stage without failing means players earn bonus hearts at the end.  However, each time a player dies, the Intensity drops ten levels, so a level set to 6.6 will drop to 5.6.  Higher Intensity settings yield more than just bonus hearts, however.  Stages routinely feature closed-off sections with numbers over the gates indicating that they can only be entered with an Intensity setting at least as high as noted.  Beyond that, treasures are likely to contain vastly more powerful weapons than lower Intensity levels.  <br><br><i>Kid Icarus Uprising</i> has a wealth of unlockables and bonus features including an Idol gallery (essentially a character and item art gallery), a practice mode, a music gallery, a mode compatible with AR Cards released for the game (it ships with six randomly selected cards), and over 200 challenges, or achievements, set up in a manner similar to the challenges in Super Smash Bros Brawl.  Up to three AR Cards may be viewed at one time, and if set facing each other, the characters may interact or battle each other.  The game also ships with a free stand for the 3DS system to aid in playing games of this nature.  The game is also compatible with Street Pass and Spot Pass for trading items such as weapons and gems.<br><br>Lastly, <i>Uprising</i> features multiplayer matches for up to six players in both local and online matches, with friends or random players.  The multiplayer matches are generally deathmatch-style affairs in either a free-for-all format or team, 3-versus-3 matches.  Similar to players saving sets of Powers for solo play, they may also save different sets of weapons and Powers for quick access for multiplayer games.  This allows players to set up equipment with various focuses tailored to their gameplay style, or styles, for multiplayer matches.  ';

	des := 'As Ubisoft did with the Wii, they''ve jumped on board with the 3DS with several titles, and no fewer than two of them are Tom Clancy franchises.  One of those Tom Clancy games is <i>Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars</i>, and it lands on the 3DS, in a sense, filling the launch-window vacancy of two very similar Nintendo franchises:  <i>Fire Emblem</i> and <i>Advance Wars</i>.  In that regard, <i>Shadow Wars</i> is played from an overhead perspective using a grid-style system to organize units in a turn-based strategy game.<br><br><b>Story</b><br><br><i>Shadow Wars</i> involves a behind-the-scenes plot by "ultranationalist" conspirators to revert Russia back to the days of the Iron Curtain, Communism, and the Cold War.  A large part of the plot involves the Russian conspirators meddling in the affairs of neighboring countries, wherein the Ghost Recon team is dispatched to clear things up.  There are six characters acting as individual units similar to Nintendo''s own <i>Fire Emblem</i> series, each with special abilities.  The six classes are Commando, Gunner, Sniper, Recon, Engineer, and Medic.  Players must learn to use each strategically to survive missions.  Missions also tend to have multiple objectives, and difficulties may be selected prior to engaging each stage.<br><br><b>Gameplay</b><br><br>The game is viewed from an overhead perspective (top screen, with 3-D depth), with limited camera adjustments available using the analog nub.  The game is largely controlled with the d-pad and buttons.  The bottom screen is used for stats and only a few segments of the game use it--mostly for players to reference detailed information in some elements in the game, such as weapon attributes.  As in <i>Fire Emblem</i> or <i>Advance Wars</i>, lightly colored squares appear over the stages indicating available player movement, attack points, and other details.  Characters have limited health and ammo, but each carries two weapons or items.  <br><br><b>Other Features</b><br><br>Besides the regular campaign (story mode), there is a Skirmish mode, which features stand-alone missions against the computer.  Like the regular game, players can choose from one of the three difficulty levels.  Players also earn points (known as PEC points) and stars from accomplishing mission objectives, and at higher difficulty settings.  The PEC points are used to increase the "rank" of the player (and track progress) and stars can be spent after missions to upgrade various attributes of the characters, such as health.  There is also a multiplayer mode that can be played using a single 3DS system, possible as the game is turn-based strategy.';

After a chase that also acts as the tutorial, he learns from Catwoman that the Arkham Blackgate prison has been taken over by Black Mask, Joker and Penguin. They each control a different part of the prison (the industrial complex, administration and cell blocks respectively) and have taken hostages. Batman ventures inside to restore order and he can choose which area to tackle first.<br><br>The game is played on a 2D plane, but with the option to move up and down as well. There are also many sequences, for instance when using the grappling hook combined with different camera perspectives, that Batman seemingly moves around as with full 3D movement and many rooms also have multiple vantage points. The game borrows many mechanics from the main games in the series. During combat Batman can punch, kick, counter, evade and string together combos. The grappling hook is used to move around quickly. He can also run, jump, hang from ledges (and do takedowns from there) and shimmy. By touching and holding the screen an analyzer is activated to scan the area. This can highlight objects important to progress and Batman can for instance interact with them by throwing the batarang. A detective mode is activated to highlight objects in yellow and enemies in red by swiping (Vita) or using the circle pad (3DS). In this mode clues can also be revealed to solve side mysteries and sometimes it is the only way to get access to additional WayneTech. Batman can switch between targets, keep track of them, and for instance attack from the air with a glide kick.<br><br>Borrowing elements from the <i>metroidvania</i> genre, the game requires backtracking to open up new routes when certain items have been found, such as an explosive gel or the batclaw, in additional to the batarang provided at the start of the game. There are small amount of stealth, but usually as a means of environment based puzzle solving (i.e. not getting killed instantly) instead of an alternative approach. Batman can for instance rappel up to the rafters or hide in sewer gates. There are one-on-one bossfights and these rely heavily on quick time events. There are also enemies not present in the main <i>Origins</i> game, such as Catwoman and Bronze Tiger. Cut-scenes are shown as still, drawn images with voiceovers and minor animations.';

New to the series is that the player can switch between the three characters on the fly. They each have different missions, lives and personalities. They also often come together, especially for heists, a complex type of mission where a large operation needs to be planned and executed by determining a strategy and hiring additional henchmen. As with previous games in the series, the gameplay involves gunfights and takes place in a sprawling, open world city where players get around by acquiring transport (cars, boats, helicopters, etc) through less than legal means. Players can roam the game world, complete story missions and partake in various illegal activities, including shooting civilians, robbing people, destruction of cars and the titular act of car theft. These lead to a wanted rating of up to five stars, sending in a police force in pursuit. Continuing to resist the police will also increase it. The wanted status is lost by getting out of sight or by spraying the car.<br><br>Michael, whilst hiding in the witness protection program as a result of a botched robbery nine years earlier, encounters Franklin who, in his capacity as a repo man, is sent to get a car from Michael''s son Jimmy. Michael however realises Franklin is being set up, so tells Franklin to crash his sons car into the dealership who sent him. After that, they become friends. One day, Michael discovers his wife in bed with another man, and with Franklin''s help, chases him to a mansion, which they promptly burn to the ground. The mansion, unfortunately, belongs to Mexican drug lord Martin Madrazo, who demands they compensate him for what they did. They successfully rob a jewelry store, and one of Michael''s old partners Trevor hears of this, and asks to team up with the other two, who agree. From here their lives begin to spiral out of control.<br><br>The game''s multiplayer component is called <i>GTA Online</i>. It is set two months before the start of the single-player story. It allows up to 16 players (PS3 / Xbox 360) or 30 players (Xbox One / PS4 / PC) to travel around a world identical to the single-player world to complete story-driven activities, both competitive and co-operative.<br><br>The later released PS4, Xbox One and PC versions have various enhancements and additional features. Technical upgrades include an increased draw distance and support for higher resolutions. New content includes new weapons, vehicles and activities, additional wildlife, denser traffic, a new foliage system, enhanced damage and weather effects. The Dodo is a classic <i>GTA</i> seaplane, there are stock car races with additional liveries, a new Imponte Duke O''Death vehicle, the Marshall Monster Truck, and the Xero Blimp. There are new shooting challenges and new weapons such as the rail gun and hatchet. New wildlife photo challenges let players unlock the Kraken submarine. A new murder mystery can be solved to unlock film noir game filters. Monkey Mosaics are a new collectible to unlock monkey outfits and Monkey Blista. There are also 100 additional songs divided over the 17 existing radio stations. The most distinct new feature is a full first-person view for the entire game, allowing the player to shoot, walk and drive from that perspective. This comes with entirely new animations for the view, showing the hands when entering cars or in melee fights, and vehicles have fully functional interiors, HUDs and interfaces.';

	des := '<i>Black Ops III</i> is the fourth game in the <i>Black Ops</i> subseries (including World at War) of the <i>Call of Duty</i> first-person shooter franchise and the twelfth main title overall. It is the follow-up to Call of Duty: Black Ops II, but not a direct sequel. Rather, it continues the time progression of battles in the past in the first <i>Black Ops</i> game, modern and near future combat in the second game, and now a game in a far dystopian future set in 2065, 40 years after the previous title. A first for the series, the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions do not have the main single-player campaign, only the multiplayer portion and additional game modes such as Zombies. The single-player campaign is substantially longer compared to the previous games.<br><br>The game is set in the same universe as <i>Black Ops II</i> and references some past events indirectly. For instance, the focus in the story is back on group troops following the aftermath of the drone strikes by Menendez in the second game. Set in the far future, soldiers are now equipped with DNI, the Direct Neural Interface. It allows them to communicate directly with computers and machines, and it can also be used to read the thoughts and memories of people. The player controls a male or female character and needs the DNI after a failed infiltration and hostage rescue mission from the NCR in Egypt. Your partner, Jacob Hendricks, undergoes the enhancements as well. Five years later the player character and Hendricks are under the command of CIA Agent Rachel Kane investigating a CIA black site in Singapore. Through a series of events the player ends up in Egypt and Switzerland. The story deals with an artificial intelligence called Corvus, the role of privacy, the effects of cybernetic enhancements, secret CIA experiments, and also the characters Commander John Taylor and Dr. Yousef Salim.<br><br>Missions include linear first-person shooter levels with free movement as well as sections played shooting from a stationary position such as a vehicle. As the game is set in the future, various futuristic technologies are available. By progressing through the game new weapons and gadgets are unlocked. The most important ones are the new abilities called Cyber Cores and Cyber Rigs. Cores provide new abilities and attacks, while Rigs influence movement and agility, opening up powerslides, wallruns and boosted jumps. There are three types of Cores and only one can be equipped per loadout. They enable the player character to distract with decoy drones, boost the character in strength or speed, attack or take over robots or keep opponents occupied with swarms of bees. The campaign can be played cooperatively with up to four players.<br><br>The same abilities return for multiplayer, but there they are mostly enabled by default and the loadout centers more on the selection of weapons, items and the enhancements for weapons. The different types of killstreaks typical for the series return. Movement is very different and faster compared to earlier titles through wallruns and boosted jumps using thruster packs. This time multiplayer games are not played with a nameless soldier, but by choosing a specific Specialist, represented by a specific class. They each have a callsign, a distinct look, a unique weapon and a unique ability. Four are available right away and the other ones are unlocked gradually. The Specialist classes available at the launch include Battery, Nomad, Outrider, Prophet, Reaper, Ruin, Seraph, Spectre. Ruin for instance has access to Gravity Spikes as a special weapon and Overdrive with enhanced speed as an ability. In certain matches players can vote to protect (keep) or ban certain Specialists, weapons and abilities. The Pick Ten system for custom loadouts from the previous game is still present. Guns can be customized through the Gunsmith feature, for both form and function.<br><br>Unlock tokens are a new element. They are needed to unlock new weapons, attachments, equipment and killstreak awards. They are earned by completing challenges and leveling up. Another type of tokens is used to trade at a Black Market to receive packages with a selection of common or rare items. Many game modes return, such as Domination, Gun Game, Hardpoint, Kill Confirmed, Search  || CHR(38) || amp; Destroy and Uplink. There are no new player-versus-player multiplayer game modes. Typical for the <i>Black Ops</i> series is the Zombies game mode with separate storylines. This time it includes an experience system, and special abilities and power-ups can be selected in the loadout. These power-ups can be bought at the Zombies version of the Black Market or through a chewing gum machine. Also new for that mode is the use of altars that temporarily turn the player character into a powerful creature. Levels contain short-cuts that can only be accessed while in creature form. The Zombies mode is now set in Morg City and introduces four new characters: Nero the Magician, Jessica the Femme Fatale, Vincent the Cop and Campbell the Boxer.<br><br>Another new game mode is Freerun where players can run through obstacle courses using the new abilities to get the fastest times. When the regular campaign is finished, the Nightmare campaign is unlocked. It remixes the original campaign with different enemies such as zombies, random weapons instead of loadouts, and the use of power-ups.';

Any tall grass can be used to hide and take out nearby mercenaries in a stealth manner. During cutscenes, Nate is sometimes given an option how to reply which does not affect the overall story but changed the conversation path or the outcome of a given even scene. In this game, a big emphasis is given to vehicles such as boats or cars, which can be driven around and even used to take out enemies blocking your way or pursuing you.

The most typical update is the actualized content for stadiums, teams (both national leagues and national teams), and players statistics. A first for the series, women''s teams are included with twelve national teams. Those matches can be played in different game modes: offline and online friendly games, and a tournament mode based on the FIFA Women''s World Cup. Mixed matches are not possible.<br><br>The main Career mode is updated with a new training mode. It is used to develop players and this is done through skill game, similar to how it was introduced in 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil. This is encouraged to raise a player''s transfer value. Prior to a new season it is possible to play a European tournament to earn additional starting money. The familiar Ultimate Team mode is also updated, focused on building a team through different decks of cards further supported through optional microtransactions for real money. There are some changes to the interface and the filtering systems for the transfer market. The versions for the different platforms are largely identical. A number of Legends (legendary players) for this game mode are exclusive to the Xbox versions, with players such as Deco, Litmanen and Giggs. FUT Draft is a new element for this mode, as a simplified version of the main game mode, but based on a selection of five players, and where Team Chemistry is equally important.<br><br>For the gameplay there are changes to the defensive mechanisms, most apparent through the better positioning of the defenders to keep the open spaces as small as possible. This can be countered on the offensive side with a ''pass with purpose'', a hard pass that can split the defense in many occasions, but is hard to control for strikers. There are new options for dribbling, for instance through faking a pose in a certain direction using the body to lure a defender in a certain direction.';

	des := '<i>Star Wars: Battlefront</i> is an action shooter and the third main game in the <i>Star Wars: Battlefront</i> series. It is considered a reboot of the franchise and it is set during the Galactic Civil War. Based on the <i>Star Wars</i> movies, it focuses on large-scale battles between Stormtroopers of the Empire and soldiers of the Alliance, rather than Sith versus Jedi. This approach is similar to the concept of the earlier games, but this title largely removes the single-player campaign in favour of more multiplayer modes, incorporating some elements of the Battlefield series the developer is known for.<br><br>The game was launched with maps based on four locations: Endor, Hoth, Sullust and Tatooine. In December 2015 two maps were added for free set on Jakku, a new location to coincide with the release of the movie <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i>. Unlike the <i>Battlefield</i> games it is not class based. Players choose a side and get to control soldiers, Snow Speeders, AT-ATs, X-Wings and Tie-Fighters in matches on large battlefields. Players choose between the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire for each game, with differences for the pick-ups and power-ups that are then available to each faction during matches. These provides auto-firing turrets or droids, a thermal imploder or vehicles. Hero pick-ups let players become famous <i>Star Wars</i> heroes such as Boba Fett, Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine, Han Solo, Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker for a short time, with unique abilities. There are also hero vehicles such as the Millennium Falcon and the Slave I.<br><br>Progress through the game is based on leveling up to access new weapons and unlocks that can then be bought with the in-game currency. Abilities can be customized through Star Cards. Up to three can be selected before starting a match and they provide abilities such as explosives, a shield or a jet pack. Some Star Cards have a cooldown, while others can only be used a few times. These Star Cards are accessible for both factions without restrictions. Similar to the Squad system in <i>Battlefield</i>, there is a partner system where two players can see each other on the map and use each other''s weapon, even if they have not been unlocked yet for both players.<br><br>There are nine multiplayer game modes, supporting eight up to 40 players simultaneously. Blast is a classic team deathmatch mode for up to 20 players. Cargo is a capture-the-flag variant with cargo boxes. Droid Run for up to 12 players is about capturing and holding three GNK Power Droids. Drop Zone for up to 16 players is about controlling escape pods that crash down. Fight Squadron is a dogfight mode between air vehicles. Supremacy is a tug-of-war mode similar to Conquest in <i>Battlefield</i>. Players need to capture five control points and then a final one with a specific order. Walker Assault is an asymmetrical mode of Imperials with a giant AT-AT moving towards a rebel base. The rebels need to stop the advance by capturing points that make the AT-AT more vulnerable and calling in Y-Wing bombers. For the heroes in the game there is Heroes vs Villains and the asymmetrical Hero Hunt where one hero takes on seven regular troopers. The single-player portion consists of Missions that can optionally be played cooperatively. They contain wave based survival games, AI bot deathmatches (optionally as a hero character) and training missions.';

	des := '<i>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</i> is the eleventh main game in the first-person shooter series. The single-player campaign is set in the future, around 2054, when Atlas, a private military corporation led by Jonathan Irons, has become the most powerful military organization on the planet. The player controls Jack Mitchell who starts as a soldier for the Marine Corps. He is stationed in Seoul, South Korea, with Will Irons. In a successful, but deadly mission against North Korea, 6.000 marines are killed including Will and Jack loses his left arm. At the funeral he is approached by Jack''s father Jonathan who offers his a job at Atlas and where he receives a high-tech prosthetic arm. The story covers several years and locations as Atlas'' intentions are slowly revealed. Next to Irons prominent characters are Gideon, Joker, Ilona, and his old sergeant Cormack. Countries and locations visited in the game include U.S.A., Greece, Bulgaria, Nigeria, South Korea, Thailand, Antarctica, and Iraq.<br><br>As the game is set in the future, Mitchell has access to high-tech exosuits that drastically enhance the soldier''s abilities. Each mission provides a different type of suit with specific powers, such as the ability to double jump, use a grappling hook, hover through boosts, become invisible through cloak, launch grenades, provide a shield or additional health, and climb metallic surfaces. Compared to other <i>Call of Duty</i> games, there are more moments with slower action, the opportunity for stealth and a number of environments that are more open so different approaches can be considered. Mitchell can be upgraded by earning points through completing challenges, allowing him to reload faster or to take more damage. Various missions provide vehicles, such as a hoverbike, a speedboat with the ability to plunge underwater, heavy mech suits, a tank, and a fighter jet. The game does not use a regular HUD, but all information is projected on the weapon through a hologram. Next to regular weapons and grenades there are weapons that rely on lasers or energy.<br><br>For multiplayer game modes include Capture the Flag and Hardpoint (returning from Call of Duty: Black Ops II), the flag based Momentum (based on the War game mode from Call of Duty 3 and Call of Duty: World at War), Domination, Kill Confirmed and others. Entirely new is the objective based Uplink mode based on carrying satellites with two teams of four to six players. The loadout is called the Pick 13 system, a variation of the <i>Black Ops II</i> Pick-10 Create-A-Class system. Players have room for thirteen items or abilities, such as a primary weapon with different attachments, different perks, scorestreak rewards etc. Scorestreaks can be customized, a first for the series, but it makes the reward more expensive. There are also regular supply drops that provide items in three categories: enlist (common), professional (uncommon), and elite (rare). These include custom weapons and customization items called reinforcements. All collected items are stored in an armory, but they can also be exchanged for additional experience instead. Just like in single-player the exosuit abilities can be used, and some of them such as boost and the grappling hook alter the movement significantly.<br><br>Like many of the previous games there is another, separate game mode, now called Exo Survival, very similar to the ones from Call of Duty: MW3 and Call of Duty: Ghosts. One to four players work together to survive multiple rounds, fighting off waves of enemies. There are four tiers to unlock and eleven rounds in total.';

	des := '<i>Fallout 4</i> is an open world role-playing game in the style of its predecessors, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. Returning gameplay features include the ability to switch between first-person and third-person perspectives, an open world with free roam exploration, a variety of combat options (including guns, explosives, unarmed, and melee), numerous sidequests along with a more linear main questline that branches toward its conclusion, dialogue options that influence the route of a conversation, and the selection of companions that aid in battle. <br><br>The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skill system also makes a return, allowing the player to decide the importance of certain skills to their character (S.P.E.C.I.A.L. being an acronym for Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck) upon leveling up. The function of perks is altered, as they are now attached to a skill tree with availability dependent on the rank of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skills that they''re associated with. The Intense Training perk is replaced by the optional ability to improve the rank of any one of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skills by leveling up, in the place of selecting a perk. The Pip-Boy can be acquired early on, and provides access to the player''s statistics, inventory, maps, and quest information as in previous games, with the added function of playing mini-games that can be found throughout the Commonwealth. The player can also make use of the Pip-Boy app in order to access the Pip-Boy menu, rather than using the in-game function. HP (health points) and AP (action points) make a return as primary statistics, with the removal of weapon and armor condition. Stimpaks, beds, and other types of consumables such as water or TV dinners can be used to restore HP. Unlike in previous games, exposure to radiation directly influences the player''s max health, and can only be reduced through RadAway or paid assistance from a doctor. AP restores over time, and can be used to sprint or attack using the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.), slowing down time and giving the player the ability to select a target with success in combat dependent on accuracy, which itself is dependent on factors such as weapon range, distance of the target, and obstruction of the target. <br><br>New features include the absence of a level cap, allowing the player to completely max their skills and acquire all perks, fully-voiced male and female protagonists, and an expansive crafting system. The player can cook food, craft drugs, add a wide variety of modifications to weapons and armor, and construct functioning settlements. Settlements may be provided with food, purified water, power, defense systems, housing, and shops that attract merchants and settlers. The player can obtain materials for building by collecting objects that may be deconstructed throughout the wasteland (classified in the Pip-Boy as "junk") or deconstructing unneeded objects, such as collapsed houses or fallen trees, all of which can be placed in the workshop for later use.<br><br>The story of <i>Fallout 4</i> begins in 2077, in an alternate retro-futuristic timeline that diverged from that of the real world following World War II. In favor of miniaturization of electronics, the world''s governments have focused on developing nuclear energy as a power source, which has led to the creation of power armor, laser weaponry, and housekeeping robots. However, despite these technological advancements, the world is in a state of crisis, as resources are scarce and nuclear war is imminent. During this time, the customizable player character lives a peaceful life in a suburban neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts with their spouse and infant son. However, the peace is interrupted when a Vault-Tec representative knocks on the family''s door. The man informs the player character that their family has recently been approved for entry into the nearby Vault 111, one of many vaults constructed by Vault-Tec as shelter against the threats of a nuclear holocaust. This visit is closely followed by a news report of a nuclear attack, giving the family no other choice but to take shelter in Vault 111, where they are tricked into a state of cryosleep. 210 years later, in the year 2287, the player character emerges from the vault, beginning their journey into a post-apocalyptic wasteland.';

	des := '<i>Battlefield 1</i> is the fifteenth main game in the <i>Battlefield</i> shooter franchise and as a main entry the follow-up to the 2013 Battlefield 4. This time it is set during World War I and it is inspired by the historic events. Like most of the main games in the series it combines a single-player campaign with an extensive amount of multiplayer modes. The campaign consists of six large missions, dubbed War Stories, each with a different protagonist, a different setting and distinct gameplay elements. The prologue "Storm of Steel" is experienced through the eyes of several Harlem Hellfighters in France and "Through Mud and Blood" is about controlling a tank in France as a British driver. "Friends in High Places" takes it to the skies in France and England as a fighter pilot for the Royal Flying Corp and in "Avanti Savoia" you are a member of the Arditi in Italy. In "The Runner" you are an ANZAC runner in Turkey and the final story "Nothing is Written" is about controlling a Bedouin warrior commanded by Lawrence of Arabia in Mesopotamia. Each story has a different approach and offers specific vehicles, weapons or play styles.<br><br>Multiplayer usually supports 24, 32 or 64 players on a single map depending on the game mode and most of these are based on the settings of the single-player War Stories. The game was launched with nine multiplayer maps: Amiens, Argonne Forest, Ballroom Blitz, Empire''s Edge, Fao Fortress, Monte Grappa, Sinai Desert, St. Quentin Scar, and Suez. There are seven game modes: Air Superiority, Conquest, Domination, Operations, Rush, Team Deathmatch, and War Pigeons. Rush, Conquest, Team Deathmatch, and Domination all return from <i>Battlefield 4</i>. Air Superiority was introduced in Battlefield 3: End Game.<br><br>War Pigeons is a team based mode where up to 24 players need to work together to locate pigeons. Once captured, a pigeon needs to be held and defended by the team, while the other team attempts to kill that player. While it is held, a message is being written and once completed the pigeon is released and the message provides the location of the enemy forces for the friendly artillery to rain down on them. The team then receives a point. Pigeon progress is sustained when it is dropped. It can also be shot when it is released and in the air, denying the point and artillery. The message is written the quickest by standing still; shooting and moving slows down the writing.<br><br>The Operations game mode builds on the concept of Rush with offence and defense. The map is split up in sectors the offensive side needs to secure. When both control points of a sector are captured, they own the sector. This goes on for several sectors until a final one is captured, but the attackers have limited respawns. The main difference is that the game takes place across several maps and the back-and-forth is turned into a large military campaign where one environment continues where the previous one ended. Attackers only have three waves to capture all maps to win the entire match. The limited respawns can be countered by using medics and the attackers receive special vehicles that allow for a big push forward. Every map has a specific type: Airship L30 (zeppelin), Armored Train, or Dreadnought (naval vessel).<br><br>Multiplayer has eight distinct classes: Assault, Cavalry, Elite, Medic, Pilot, Scout, Support, and Tanker. A new element is the introduction of a persistent squad where a team of up to five players can remain together as a single unit, even when moving between different servers. Warbonds is the in-game currency used to buy items and gear. There are many authentic weapons such as artillery, flamethrowers, hand guns and small arms, machine guns, many types of rifles, shotguns and mustard gas. Gas can countered by wearing a mask, but this limits both hearing and viewing. Weapons have many types of customization options. There is also a large amount of melee weapons divided in two groups to support the trench based combat including bayonets, clubs, sabres and shovels. Armed vehicles include aircraft, battleships tanks, trucks, and zeppelin. It is also possible to ride a horse into battle.';

The ability to play together with someone else returns to the Seasons mode, but players who prefer not to go against a team controlled by two players can disable this in the matchmaking. Matchmaking now also immediately searches a new opponent after a game is over.<br><br>The major changes to the gameplay itself focus on tighter through balls. Technical players are able to show their dribbling skills and team mates have an improved run strategy to anticipate the passes. The ball has been made more loose in players'' handling, adding an element of randomness and more types of shots based on player ability, position and power. Theres also a larger chance of defenders deflecting the balls trajectory when in the line of a shot instead of just stopping it. The AI of keepers has been altered in accordance with the gameplay changes, adding in multiple calculation moments (when a ball changes trajectory for instance) and last minute saves.<br><br>A final change is added focus on atmosphere to make the presentation resemble TV broadcoasts more closely. This edition also adds pitch deformation where the actions of players leave can wear the pitch down with marks. An entirely new feature is Matchday Live where all real life news headlines about the chosen club are brought together on a single page. The next real match is shown and it can be played right away.';

	des := '<i>Destiny</i> is a futuristic first-person shooter set in a persistent world. When humans first set foot on Mars they discovered the Traveler, a giant sphere that then allowed mankind to colonize space quickly. Centuries later the Darkness, an enemy of the Traveler, arrived and waged war against it and all of its creations. The Traveler is forced to scarify itself as a measure of protection and what is left of humanity on Earth is forced to live in a city constructed underneath. The Traveler enlists warriors known as Guardians with special abilities as a personal army. These Guardians are guided by Ghosts, artificial intelligence. The player''s character is found by such a Ghost (acting as a robot companion in the game) and becomes a Guardian.<br><br>At the start the player chooses a class (Titan, Hunter or Warlock - corresponding with the classic Fighter, Rogue and Mage) and then customizes the appearance through race (Human, Awoken or Exo), gender, face, hair and marking. Each class has distinct abilities. The Titan is a fighter with an advanced mech suit, the Hunter is a bounty hunter with a knack for reconnaissance and ranged weapons, and the Warlock is a magical being that uses spells and explosives. Each class has various subclasses (unlocked at level 15) and specific abilities and statistics. None of the weapons in the game are restricted to a single class. The most distinct differences are the grenade types, jump abilities, melee attack and a special ability. The game borrows elements from the MMORPG genre in its design, with the Tower as a main hub zone to interact with NPCs, buy weapons, gear and Ghost upgrades, receive mail, buy and upgrade ships etc. Rewards for completing missions can also usually be collected here. The other major zones are Earth, the Moon, Mars and Venus, with some additional locations. While fighting, movement and jumps are important when confronting enemies. A Guardian can wield up to three main weapons (primary, special and heavy) next to grenades and other abilities. Only one weapon of each type can be equipped, but nine more for each type can be stored in an inventory to swap them.<br><br>Ships are used to travel through space to other planets. These voyages are not an interactive scene however as the game does not have a complete open world design. Each planet has its own story and various quests. Players complete missions by defeating enemies, collecting loot. Glimmer, the main currency is used to buy upgrades, vehicles, emblems ... The character also gains experience and levels up, accessing new abilities. From level 18 Vanguard Marks are unlocked as an additional currency for high-end gear, along with Vanguard Reputation as a reward for completing bounties. There are daily and weekly challenges to earn Marks, but the amount that can be earned has time constrictions. From level 20 the general experience system is replaced by Mote of Light. At that level the characters also gets to join one of three factions: Dead Orbit, New Monarchy or Future War Cult. The main story consists of different campaign missions that need to be completed for The Speaker, unlocked gradually and opened up on Earth, Moon, Venus and Mars respectively. Once unlocked however, they can be completed in any order. Next to the mission progression it is possible to enter a planet in exploration mode, offering free exploration. Each planet generally has five major story missions. These can be completed alone or in groups of six players working together.<br><br>Players can also optionally organize themselves in Fireteams for Strike missions, similar to MMORPG dungeons, that are harder with various mini-bosses and bosses. Fireteams are organized through online matchmaking and it is possible to make them public or private, and invite players. Only in Fireteams is voice chat possible. Outside of it communication is limited to gestures and prompts. Players also do not see all other online players at that location, only a selection. For the instance missions, the player''s character (and possibly other team members) are drawn in a private part in the game, cut off from the open game world. In these section characters can revive each other and there are checkpoints for respawns. Loot is personalized and does not need to be distributed between players. Each planet contains five major loot chests. Certain weapons and armour have a ranking system where they become better over time. There are also various types of engrams, a type of pattern for weapons or amour that can be turned into a special item with colour coding for the rarity level. Decoding them improves a separate ranking system with leveling to access additional engrams. When dead, other players can attempt to revive the player''s character with its Ghost nearby or eventually it respawns. Moving around on planets can be done on speeder bikes.<br><br>There are also Raids, much harder cooperative missions added gradually by the developer that do not support matchmaking and can only be taken on with players at a high level with high-end gear. Unlike Strike missions, no objectives or directions are given, players have to figure it out for themselves. Raids can be paused and resumed, unlike most of the rest of the game, but are reset after a weekly cycle. Competitive multiplayer is available in the The Crucible PvP game mode in a separate location. It offers game modes unlocked gradually including Clash, Control, Skirmish and Rumble. They come with different team sizes and include team deathmatch, capturing zones, team modes with vehicles and more. Level differences between players are nullified except for the skill tree unlocks, but the strength of the gear, weapons and equipped items makes a significant difference. The Crucible offers Crucible Marks as a currency along with Crucible Reputation.';

	des := '<i>Final Fantasy XV</i> is the fifteenth main installment in the <i>Final Fantasy</i> series. It is an open world role-playing game set in the fictional world of Eos. It is almost entirely ruled by the empire of the militaristic Niflheim, except for the kingdom of Lucis. The Lucians have been able to keep Niflheim at bay, mainly because the capital Insomnia is protected by the Wall, a magical shield powered by a crystal. At the start of the game an armistice is proposed as well as a union of states through the marriage of Prince Noctis of Lucis and Lady Lunafreya of Tenebrae, a separate nation with limited political power due to the influence of a priestess called the Oracle. The game opens when Noctis, the only playable character, travels with his friends Gladiolus, Ignis and Prompto to Accordo where the wedding is to take place. Along the way it is revealed Niflheim has betrayed Lucis and the crystal has been stolen with many important figures killed. Noctis'' main quest becomes to reclaim the throne and rescue the crystal.<br><br>The group of characters gets to explore the world, mainly using the car Regalia and later on also use the galliform Chocobo birds. The story focuses significantly on the bond between the characters and presents their journey as a road trip. They can only travel by day as powerful demons roam the world at night, so they always need to find an inn or go camping at a safe spot to spend the night. The car also needs regular refueling. Later on a fast travel option becomes available. The game has many contemporary elements, such as the use of cell phones. There are many cut-scenes and conversations between characters, there are shops to visit, and Ignis uses different ingredients to cook meals. There are several side quests, hunts, optional dungeons and also fishing. The later parts of the game move away from the open world and have a more linear design.<br><br>Combat is done through free movement, much like Final Fantasy Type-0 or the Kingdom Hearts series by the same developer. The turn-based and Active Time Battle systems the series is known for are replaced by a real-time combat system known as Active Cross Battle. It allows for attacks and different weapons, blocking and parrying, mana-consuming spells and context related actions such as using cover and the use of heights with complete freedom of movement. The other three characters are controlled by the AI, but commands can be issued along with cooperative Links as battle actions. Elemental magic is based on the elements fire, ice and thunder with lots of customization options for the spells, also combined with items. Ring magic becomes available later on when Noctis possesses the Ring of the Lucii. Optionally combat can be done using a wait mode where the entire environment is paused when Noctis does not move.<br><br>There is a global experience level and characters can level up by visiting havens as safe zones. There are also ability points that can be spent on the Ascension Grid skill tree with abilities for combat, magic and passive abilities. The four friends each have a hobby where they can level up. Noctis fishes, Ignis cooks, Prompto takes pictures and Gladiolus has survival skills.<br><br>The base version of the game, also called <i>Day One Edition</i> or <i>Digital Day One Edition</i> is the only standard version of the game and comes bundled with the Masamune as a DLC weapon.';

	des := '<i>Dishonored 2</i> is the sequel to Dishonored and it is set about fifteen years after the events of the first game. It had different endings and this game picks up the story for the one with the best outcome for the characters. Corvo Attano, once framed for the murder of empress Jessamine Kaldwin and the kidnapping of her daughter Emily, has his name cleared and is now Royal Protector of Emily, the new empress of the fictional Empire of the Isles. She has to deal with the Crown Killer, someone who is against her will killing all her enemies and opposition, making it look like she rules with an iron fist and undermining her power. At the same time early on in the story she is deposed by the Delilah Copperspoon, known especially from the first game''s story DLC, who claims the throne and says to be the older sister of Jessamine. She violently seizes power with the help of Luca Abele, Duke of Serkonos.<br><br>The change of regime is hostile and immediately the player has to choose between two protagonists, either Corvo or Emily, as the main character for the entire game. In the first game only Corvo was available and now there are two, each with their own supernatural abilities. Those can also be discarded entirely by rejecting the Outsider''s help and just like the first title it can also be approached as a pure action game with melee and ranged combat, as a pure stealth game or as a mix of everything. Unlike the first game there is no silent protagonist as they both are voiced and speak throughout the game. The game is no longer set in Dunwall except for a short part early on, but in the coastal city Karnaca in the southern part of the Empire of the Isles. Architecture, fashion and technology now draw from 19th century European countries like Greece, Italy and Spain. Where the first game linked together environments as hubs with loading times, Karnaca has a more of an open world-style approach as a single environment, but the game still uses hubs as large sandbox environments for missions. There is a main quest to pursue, but the character can also freely explore and discover many side quests or optional activities in a random order. Overall there are nine, large missions that usually each have a distinct environment such as the Addermire Institute, the Clockwork Mansion or the Royal Consevatory. Next to the overall design many of these locations have very different mechanics. A ship called the Dreadful Whale often transports the character between missions.<br><br>Just like Corvo, Emily has access to the Outsider''s Mark and can choose to use supernatural abilities or reject them entirely. Emily''s abilities often focus on distraction and they are Domino to link the fate and actions of two or more characters, Doppelganger to create a clone, Far Reach as a grappling hook, Mesmerize to turn enemies into a dream state and Shadow Walk to turn into smoke for stealth or to move through vents. Corvo''s familiar abilities are Bend Time, Blink, Dark Vision, Devouring Swarm and Possession. Abilities can be upgraded, for instance for Corvo''s Blink to pass through glass without breaking it or Emily''s Far Reach to snatch items harpoon-style. For stealth it is possible to knock out, drag and throw enemies, it is possible to distract using sound and alarms, and guards have an awareness meter based on sound, discoveries and alerting each other, and vision. The rat plague from the original game is replaced by blood flies. They can attack the character, but can also be turned into a distraction. When more enemies are killed, more flies appear.<br><br>Runes need to be discovered or bought at black markets to upgrade the abilities. The bone charm system of the original title returns, but in a new form. Players can now craft custom bone charms after unlocking that power, as equippable items that provide new powers. Bonecharms can add invisibility or invulnerability to specific actions or improve actions such as sprinting or swimming, or the regeneration of health or mana. Next to coins as the main currency, blueprints need to be located to upgrade the arsenal and there are paintings as optional collectibles. Based on the character''s aggressiveness and assassinations, a chaos level is determined which influences the outcome.';

It marks the return of the original developer of the first two games. It is set one year after the events of the second game Batman: Arkham City. It starts when Scarecrow forces an evacuation of Gotham City by threatening to release a fear toxin. Many familiar characters and foes are present. The title refers to a new villain called Arkham Knight who backs Scarecrow. He wears a militaristic Batsuit and an Arkham symbol on his chest.<br><br>The game is set in an open world environment for Arkham City with main missions, side missions and the Riddler trophies that can be pursued freely. Familiar game elements return, such as the many melee combat sections, the use of gadgets and stealth abilities, and detective skills to examine clues in the environment and solve puzzles. Gadgets are used both during combat and while exploring. They include batarangs (now also used as a way to explore the environment), the batclaw, a disruptor, an electrical charge gun, explosive gel, freeze blast, grapnel gun, a line-launcher, a remote hacking device, smoke pellets, a voice synthesizer etc. Many of these return from previous games. Exploration is largely done using long flights with the cape.<br><br>An entirely new game element is the introduction of the batmobile as a playable vehicle for both exploration and combat. While on foot it can be summoned right away and Batman is able to eject to go into flight without interruption. The car is bulletproof, can smash through obstacles and is equipped with weapons. There are two modes to control the vehicle: Battle or Pursuit. Pursuit is used mostly for transportation and driving challenges. Battle provides tank-like controls for the car, with 360-degree range of movement, strafing and a large weapons arsenal. Next to the regular gameplay there are many sequences where the batmobile is used. The car can be controlled remotely and various upgrades such as an EMP gun can be equipped.<br><br>The combat retains the familiar combo and counter system. Enemy medics are new. They are able to shield certain enemies or revive unconscious ones. Fights are rewarded with experience points that are used to unlock new moves, health upgrades and new abilities for gadgets. Batman sometimes fights along allies (Catwoman, Nightwing, Robin) and the game introduces a Dual Play system where seamlessly switching during combat provides access to double takedowns.';

It is an open world game that can be explored on foot or by driving cars, trucks, buses, boats or bikes. Just like in the original game the protagonist, now Marcus Holloway, is a member of the Dedsec hackers collective. The game is now set in San Francisco, Oaklan, Marin and Silicon Valley with a size twice as large as Chicago in the previous game. Again the group goes against the control of ctOS (Central Operating System), now in 2.0 version, as a means to control all of the city as well as to spy on its citizens.<br><br>There are many famous landmarks in the game with special attention to the Silicon Valley and its many companies and employees which are often the centre of jokes. Many story sequences are presented as cut-scenes. At the start of the game Holloway is not a member of the collective yet. He is identified by ctOS as a potential threat and this leads him to breach the data centre and delete his ctOS profile, which impresses the Dedsec group. The fellow hackers he works with are Horatio, Josh, Sitara and Wrench. The goal is to take down ctOS and its company Blume. They also raise awareness as completing missions is rewarded with followers, people who take notice, as a means to further the narrative.<br><br>The different missions can often be completed in various ways. Enemies can be approached directly with gunplay, but most assignments encourage the use of stealth and a large amount of technological gadgets often accessed and controlled through Holloway''s in-game smartphone. Typical actions include hacking phones for voice and text messages, changing traffic lights, disabling security systems, taking over camera systems, controlling cars, turning junction boxes into proximity mines  and so on. The quadrocopter is entirely new as a drone that can be flown to scout locations as often terminals need to be reached with puzzle sections before a hack is successful. Another type of drone is a remote-controlled car can be driven to hack terminals from a remote location. Hacking is also often a means to attack enemies from a distance, for instance by activating cars and driving them into opponents. Marcus has some acrobatic, parkour-like moves to get around.<br><br>Additional options become available through an upgrade system. There are three categories which fit different playstyles: Agressor, Ghost and Trickster. Holloway is able to issue fake warrants so random citizens are arrested in police actions. He can also lure gangs into wars to make a location less densely populated. When he attracts too much attention himself the police attempts to hunt him down. Money earned during missions can be spent in various ways, for instance by creating weapons through 3D printing. Many side missions and additional information can often be found by snooping on anyone walking around. Cars can be stolen or they are delivered using an phone app. Large distances can also be crossed using a fast travel system. There are optional eKart races, also rewarded with money and followers. Sailing and participating in races is supported as well. Holloway can be customized through a large amount of clothing options.<br><br>The single-player game morphs seamlessly in a multiplayer environment when there is an online connection. That means that other online players can be encountered at any moment. Players can choose to cooperate and work together on missions or they can hack each other. In the latter called invasions someone installs viruses on another player''s system and needs to complete the process and escape. The targeted player can win by locating or killing the hacker in the vicinity before time runs out. Players can also work together to neutralize other players causing havoc in a Bounty Hunter session.';

The game is set in Kyrat, a fictional region based on the Himalayan regions of Nepal. It is governed by the depostic king Pagan Min. The player controls Ajay Ghale, an American with Kyrati roots who returns to the region to disperse his deceased mother''s ashes. As soon as he arrives he is dragged into the conflict and is rescued by the rebel organization The Golden Path started by his parents. During the game the Ajay can eventually choose which force to side with, with different endings. Inside The Golden Path there is a power struggle, and Ajay can choose between missions for Amita or Sabal, with different objectives based on the choices.<br><br>The mountainous region has both lush environments and snowy mountains. Vertical heights can be scaled using a grappling hook, and a glider or a zipline is used to move down. The player can follow the story missions or explore freely. Various vehicles are available to cross the distances and there is a fast travel option for important locations. There is an auto drive option where vehicles follow the roads to the next waypoint while the player can concentrate on shooting. Typical game elements that return are hunting animals (rhinos, pigs, bears, eagles, wolves, elephants ...) to craft upgrades, collecting plants for syringes, exploring locations for loot that can be sold at shops, trading points and sherpas, and a large amount of weapons including a bow, both melee weapons and long-ranged guns, grenades, mines, and explosives. It is possible to ride elephants as well. Next to the main quest there are various side quests and random karma events for separate karma points. Next to money and experience gained to level up, skills points are provided. These can be spent in The Tiger (aggressive) or The Elephant (defensive) skill tree. There are also a large amount of collectibles such as propaganda posters, masks, lost letters and pages of Mohan Ghale''s journal.<br><br>Bell towers can be climbed to remove the fog from sections of the map. There are 24 outposts to infiltrate and four large fortresses. It is possible to reset outposts to take them over using another tactic. Guns for hire tokens can be used to call in back-up for tough missions. Just like the previous game a stealth approach is always possible. Ajay can shoot open cages or throw bait to use wild animals to cause havoc. Stones can be thrown as a distraction. Both animals and enemies can be tagged with the camera to track movement. An indicator shows if Ajay has been discovered and guards have different alert states. Enemies can be taken out silently using a takedown, a throwing knife, weapons with a suppressor or the bow. The hunter is a new type of enemy that moves silently and can only be tagged for a short time. They quickly disappear, attempt to take you out and can charm animals to attack you. The game has a day and night cycle and Ajay can now sleep in a bed for a certain amount of time to skip the night for instance.<br><br>The single-player campaign can be played cooperatively (except for the main story missions). When playing alone and in a difficult situation, you can send a request for help for someone to join you, and vice versa. Online multiplayer is also supported through Battles of Kyrat, with different types of game modes such as Outpost, Demon Mask or Propaganda. Players who do not own the game can be invited to play along using a limited amount of keys. A level editor is included as well.';

	des := '<i>Assassin''s Creed: Syndicate</i> is the ninth major game in the <i>Assassin''s Creed</i> series and like previous titles it is a third-person action game with stealth set in a large open world environment. This game takes place in London in 1868 during the Industrial Revolution. Like many of the earlier games it is told as a simulation played in the present using the Animus technology from the Abstergo company from the viewpoint of an anonymous Assassin initiate. In the present Rebecca Crane and Shaun Hastings clash with the Templars who are searching for a Piece of Eden in modern day London. There are regularly short sequences in modern times, but the game is almost entirely played in the simulation of London following the Assassin twins Jacob and Evie Frye who look for Pieces of Eden. Their main target is also to thwart the Templar Grand Master Crawford Starrick who rules all of London by day and uses the Blighters street gang at night to get his dirty work done. Jacob and Evie need to bring him down by influencing and infiltrating the criminal underground, but also need to take over London with their Rooks gang fighting the Blighters, one area at a time.<br><br>After the initial sequences players can freely swap between Jacob and Evie at any moment in the open world, a first for the series, but they each have their separate main missions. Evie favours a stealth approach and is mostly after the Pieces of Eden, while Jacob is more confrontational in his actions and mainly wants to bring down Starrick. In the background many other Assassins are at work to stop the Templar control over the city. Most side missions are open to any character, but the main ones require a specific character to complete them. The characters have their separate storyline, but these often intersect. There are some separate missions that take place in a very different time as well, due to an Animus glitch that opens rifts in time. Many famous historical characters are a part of the story, such as Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, Florence Nightingale and Charles Dickens. There are also iconic buildings and environment such as Westminster Palace, the Big Ben, the Bank of England, the Tower of London and Buckingham Palace. The characters share money, experience and rewards, but have separate gear and skills. Like earlier titles a currency and experience is earned to buy and upgrade gear and weapons. Experience is converted into skill points that can be invested in three skill trees: combat, stealth and ecosystem.<br><br>As with previous game exploration and climbing is encouraged through a free running system. It is similar to the one in Assassin''s Creed: Unity with two options to pursue a path up or down. Entirely new to the series is the use of moving trains and driving through London using horse-drawn carriages, including one as a mobile headquarters. This is used to transport people or goods, or chase enemies, but it is also possible to kidnap enemies, put them in a carriage and demand a ransom. A rope launcher can be used to rappel up buildings quickly and it can also used as a zipline (returning from Assassin''s Creed: Revelations) to get down. There is a separate stealth system based on a ring and eagle eye vision. Fighting is done using close combat melee attacks with fists, brass knuckles and canes. There are also ranged weapons with many types of pistols. The system to punch, attack and block/counter is fairly similar to previous games. Enemies can now be beaten into a ''near death'' status where they remain defenseless. When this is done for several enemies, there is an opportunity for spectacular multi-kill finishing moves and executions. With a later skill, performing these can also scare other enemies away.<br><br>Next to the main missions there are various sidequests and activities to earn additional money such as carriage races and fight clubs. Many additional missions are based around territory control, taking over London sector by sector, similar to the gameplay of Assassin''s Creed: Brotherhood. This is done by completing activities and killing rival gang members. To completely secure a sector a large-scale gang war needs to be fought. The presence of Rooks in the area then becomes immediately visible and it is possible to invest in various gang upgrades to make them stronger. Unlike the previous titles back to <i>Brotherhood</i>, there is no multiplayer component to the game. Compared to the previous game the leveling system has been simplified, there are less currencies and there is no (required) integration of a companion app to unlock certain content. A few extras can be unlocked by logging into Ubisoft Club. Optionally the in-game currency can be bought with real money.';

The basic gameplay works like in previous iterations but with some changes both in presentation and gameplay. This include upgraded player models and new animations, more realistic ball and rim physics and player collisions. Changes in controls include dedicated buttons for lobs and bounce passes. In addition to playing individual exhibition matches there are numerous other game modes such as MyCareer, MyGM, MyLeague and MyTeam.<br><br>The MyCareer mode is called Livin'' Da Dream and was developed in association with film maker Spike Lee. It is designed to be more story oriented and cinematic than previous games'' career modes and sees the player taking control of a young basketball player from Harlem called Frequency Vibrations ("Freq"). Freq starts out in a small high school team but as the story progresses he will move first to a college team and later the NBA. The ultimate goal is to become one of the greatest players of all time. Before starting out it is possible to customize the appearance of the player and to choose a position and scoring style. Games in the career modes only involve controlling one player with the others being AI driven. Between games the player has access to his own customizable court where he can upgrade his character or practice playing the game. It''s also possible to invite online friends to private games. In addition to playing the games the career mode also involves making choices off the court while interacting with other players, coaches, media and fans. <br><br>The MyGM mode allows the player to become the general manager of a team. This means the player has access to all aspects of the game including signing and trading players, negotiating contracts with both players and coaches, interacting with the team owner as well as media, building facilities and many other managerial tasks. New to this edition is the ability to move the team to a new city, summer leagues, three team trades and the ability to customize arenas and jerseys. The MyLeague mode is similar to MyGM but removes certain restrictions to make the game more flexible with more customization options. Whereas MyGM is an offline mode, MyLeague features various online components. The MyTeam mode involves building a team by collecting trading cards. By collecting cards players, playbooks and other items can be unlocked. Cards are bought with virtual currency and come in packs with a random selection of items. They have different levels indicating how good they are with bronze cards being cheaper, while gold cards are of higher quality. ';

	des := '<i>Battlefield 4</i> is a military first-person shooter set in the near future and basically a direct continuation of Battlefield 3. Like all games in the series, the focus is on its multiplayer mode in which player either take the role of an assault (front soldiers with medic abilities), recon (snipers), support (front soldiers who can give out ammo) or engineers (explosives experts). All classes have special abilities and gadgets which can be unlocked over time. In a variety of mostly team-based playing variants - most importantly conquest in which certain points on the maps have to be held by the own team and the faster rush mode with an defending team and an attacking team which has to destroy certain points - players face each other on usually big maps with a variety of vehicles to use. <br><br>Of course this instalments features various small and big differences to its predecessors. The most important are the interactive "Levolution" elements which emphasize the destroyable areas; one of the unique selling points of the Frostbite engine: each map has one level element which significantly changes how the level looks and plays when destroyed. <i>Battlefield 4</i> also brings back two elements from previous instalments: naval warfare and the commander mode. The commander is an additional player who sees the level from an overhead map, gives orders to the team members and can assign missile strikes. In contrast to Battlefield 2, the commander is not an actual player character on the battlefield and therefore can''t be killed. New playing modes are Defuse (both teams have to detonate a bomb in a target zone, each player has only one "life" per round) and Obliteration (there spawns only one bomb pack on the map which has to be used to detonate three points on the map).<br><br>Like the predecessor, <i>Battlefield 4</i> features a singleplayer campaign. A Chinese general overthrows the government, starts a war with the whole world (but is allied with Russia) and the USA has to save the day. The player takes the role of a faceless soldier named Recker, as commander of a small troop he can assign basic orders, who has to survive several missions of the usual Call of Duty variety: linear levels with a lot of boom and hundreds of enemies to shoot. In comparison to <i>Battlefield 3</i>, some levels are a bit more and in some cases the player drives a vehicle. Of course there are also the usual stealth and torture sequences. There is no co-op mode anymore.<br><br>The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions only allow 24 instead of 64 players at a time and have therefore smaller multiplayer maps.';

	des := '<i>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</i> is a third-person action game with a focus on stealth and the final game in the <i>Metal Gear</i> series. Canonically it is the fifth game in the series, but it is the eleventh main installment overall. It is the sequel to Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes released the year before and a prequel to the original Metal Gear. The gameplay borrows and expands upon most of the mechanics introduced in <i>Ground Zeroes</i>, which was a smaller slice in content in anticipation of this title. The game is set in 1984 with Big Boss also known as Punished "Venom" Snake as the protagonist. It takes place in Afghanistan and the border between Angola and Zaire as Big Boss seeks revenge against the Cipher group led by Skull Face who destroyed his forces and almost killed him in <i>Ground Zeroes</i>. At the start of the game he wakes up in a military hospital in Cyprus and is almost immediately attacked by soldiers and a strange, burning creature. Eventually he is rescued by Ocelot, he locates Kaz Miller and the trio then establishes a base to hunt down Cipher and its covert strike force XOF with commander Skull Face.<br><br>The game has a complex story with the typical long cut-scene sequences, but there are fewer and they are shorter compared to earlier <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> titles. Most of the gameplay mechanics introduced in <i>Ground Zeroes</i> are carried over. It is still an action game and stealth oriented, but replaces the linear corridor design from most earlier titles with large open world environments that offer the player unrestricted freedom for the approach. <i>Ground Zeroes</i> only offered a single environment, while this game has many and brings back the base building feature from Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker. To access advanced tools and weapons, Big Boss needs to complete missions for Miller so he can expand the main Mother Base. The player needs to focus on a consistent flow of the GMP currency to manage the base, research new technologies, hire soldiers and use money during missions for instance to call in an air strike. Next to merely completing missions, a Fulton technology can be used to transport back items, weapons, vehicles and even soldiers with interesting abilities to the Mother Base to use them. Soldiers can be assigned to different teams for combat, research or gathering intel. Eventually they can be sent out to complete missions on their own, providing additional GMP. A companion app on a real smartphone can be used to manage the base as well.<br><br>The game world has a real-time day and night cycle and various weather effects that influence enemy behaviour, visibility and sound, for instance with rain and sandstorms. Sabotaging or destroying certain structures can also influence other parts of the map. There are large distances to travel with different vehicles. Big Boss can travel on foot, on horseback or use a plane, a motorcycle, a patrol vehicle, a tank or a helicopter. Missions can be played entirely as an action game, but a large amount of mechanics and rewards are based around stealth. He can run, sneak and crawl along with scouting enemy patterns. It is possible to render guards unconscious, kill them or use sound to lure some in a certain direction. Enemies have various alert statuses and will investigate or trigger alarms when they are suspicious or find bodies or destroyed security cameras, changing their patrol routes. There are many entry points going underground, through gates or finding an entry by climbing. Optionally it is possible to take out enemies from far using a sniper rifle or by smuggling an explosive device into the base to blow it up.<br><br>With each new technology new options become available, introducing drones, special types of weapon enhancements, a taser, echolocation and so on. Many types of buddies are provided over time, accompanying Big Boss, with various upgrade options. Initially there is his horse D-Horse, but later on also the wolf pup D-Dog, the female sniper Quiet, and the mobile weapons platform D-Walker. Next to the main missions there are several boss battles against powerful characters. A multiplayer mode allows players to build a second Mother Base, called the Forward Operating Base. It complements the main single-player game to gather resources and expand it, but it can be attacked by other players who will try to steal resources. Players defend their own base and can attack others. This can happen in the middle of a story mission and it is possible to quickly call in friends to help with the defense. This part of the game has microtransactions with real money to speed up certain elements. In October 2015 the console versions were updated with a second multiplayer mode as a successor to Metal Gear Online. There are several game modes where players or team of players fight each other. It has a safe hub inspired by the single-player Africa map, but expanded, where all weapons and abilities can be tested with unlimited ammo before accessing a lobby to play the game.';

	des := '<i>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</i> is an action role-playing game. It takes place between J.R.R. Tolkien''s <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. You play as Talion, a ranger of Gondor guarding Black Gate. Talion and his family are killed by Sauron''s armies led by Black Hand, but Talion is possessed by a mysterious wraith and is transferred to Mordor. His goal is avenging his family and revealing the identity of the wraith.<br><br><i>Shadow of Mordor</i> is an open world game, where you have freedom to explore Mordor and completing side quests. The game combines elements of the Assassin''s Creed series in terms of freely roaming the world and the Batman: Arkham series in terms of the combat system with complex combinations of offensive and defensive moves, and finishers.<br><br>The game uses a Nemesis system that remembers Talion''s interactions with enemies, adapting their behavior at a later time. For example, a defeated orc might want to take revenge on Talion, humiliating him in a similar manner and wear the scars of the previous fight. The Nemesis system also generates the bodyguards, captains and war chiefs of Sauron''s armies. They have their own hierarchy and become stronger as they manage to kill you, rising in the ranks. Captains who manage to beat Talion grow in strength and are promoted, and in time they become a serious challenge and a personal vendetta. Even though there are many fighting sequences, a large amount of stealth is encouraged to avoid overwhelming confrontations until many new weapons and abilities provide a wider range of tackling large groups. Captains can be killed permanently (usually by beheading them with a finisher), or you can choose to have them return at a later time through a regular kill. It is also possible to brand enemies which puts them under your influence. That way you can exercise control over them and have them fight by your side, but as it can be applied to all stages of the orc hierarchy it can also be used to influence the system from the inside. You can order a captain to kill his fellow captains and help determine their replacements.<br><br>The player can develop the abilities of Talion both as a ranger and as a wraith. Ranger abilities enhance stealth and make moving through the world unnoticed easier, while wraith abilities allow him to influence minds of enemies, allowing for example obtain information about captains and spreading unrest in enemy''s ranks. The information for instance reveals immunity or weak points of specific captains, providing an advantage for a next fight.<br><br>The later released Xbox 360 and PS3 versions have reduced graphics. The Nemesis AI system has also been reduced significantly is depth and variety. Content-wise, it is largely identical.<br><br>The pre-order retail release (US version only) of the game for PS4 includes a DLC voucher for downloading Blood Hunters Warband DLC and Flesh Burners Warband DLC. The voucher is valid from September 30, 2014 until December 31, 2024.';

The plot is set about 20 years after the events of the previous game where the ending revealed that Shinnok used the void after Shao Kahn''s death to attack Earthrealm with his army of Netherrealm forces. Several characters work together to steal Shinnok''s amulet and imprison him inside, but eventually Mileena hatches a plan to release Shinnok by bringing the amulet to Quan Chi who escaped when Shinnok was imprisoned. The gap in years is mainly used to introduce the new characters to the cast, such as Cassie, the daughter of Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade (who married and divorced), Kotal Kahn as the new emperor of the Outworld, and Takeda, the son of Kenshi.<br><br>The game stays close to the visual style and the mechanics of the 2011 reboot. The main controls are still based on two types of punches and kicks, and blocking, to form combos with uppercuts, teleports, special moves that incorporate weapons and fatalities. The three-tiered energy from the previous title returns, making available X-Ray moves, powered up EX moves and combo breakers. As introduced in Injustice: Gods Among Us by the same developer characters can use the environment to re-position themselves or optionally use parts as weapons. Each character now has three variations with different moves and weapons. There is once again a sprinting gauge, returning from Mortal Kombat 4.<br><br>The trademark fatalities finishing moves are expanded with new types of finishers. Multiplayer games have quitalities where a character is immediately killed when a player leaves an online game prematurely and faction kills that are finishers tied to one of the game''s five factions. Brutality finishing moves return from Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, as powerful versions of moves that can be used at certain moments to link a combo into a finisher right away.<br><br>The recurring cast includes Ermac, Jax, Johnny Cage, Kano, Kenshi, Kitana, Kung Lao, Liu Kang, Mileena, Quan Chi, Raiden, Reptile, Scorpion, Shinnok, Sonya Blade and Sub-Zero. New playable characters are Cassie Cage, D''Vorah, Erron Black, Ferra/Torr, Jacqui Briggs, Kotal Kahn, Kung Jin and Takeda. There are 24 characters in total. Additional ones such as Goro, Jason Voorhees, Predator, Tanya and Tremor are either offered as DLC, appear as guest characters, or both. Baraka, Rain and Sindel appear in the story mode, but are not playable.<br><br>Next to the main Story mode there is King of the Hill, ranked matches, Survivor and Test Your Luck where fights have random round parameters. The Towers as challenges return, but now with play conditions that change constantly in the Living Towers. The online game has a persistent game mode called Faction Wars where players choose one of five factions (Black Dragon, the Brotherhood of Shadow, the Lin Kuei, Special Forces, and White Lotus) to fight in constant, cross-platform competitions to become the ruling faction. Competing in the Faction Wars is rewarded with a personal and faction-based leveling system, a currency, and the aforementioned faction kills. More outrageous types of fights such as one-versus-two or very difficult boss fights do not return from the previous game. Koins are the main currency in the game. They can be used to acquire secondary fatalities, brutalities, concept art, character skins and more. These are bought in the first-person dungeon crawling Krypt mode, returning from the previous game.';

It is an open world game that can be explored on foot or by driving cars, trucks, buses, boats or bikes. Just like in the original game the protagonist, now Marcus Holloway, is a member of the Dedsec hackers collective. The game is now set in San Francisco, Oaklan, Marin and Silicon Valley with a size twice as large as Chicago in the previous game. Again the group goes against the control of ctOS (Central Operating System), now in 2.0 version, as a means to control all of the city as well as to spy on its citizens.<br><br>There are many famous landmarks in the game with special attention to the Silicon Valley and its many companies and employees which are often the centre of jokes. Many story sequences are presented as cut-scenes. At the start of the game Holloway is not a member of the collective yet. He is identified by ctOS as a potential threat and this leads him to breach the data centre and delete his ctOS profile, which impresses the Dedsec group. The fellow hackers he works with are Horatio, Josh, Sitara and Wrench. The goal is to take down ctOS and its company Blume. They also raise awareness as completing missions is rewarded with followers, people who take notice, as a means to further the narrative.<br><br>The different missions can often be completed in various ways. Enemies can be approached directly with gunplay, but most assignments encourage the use of stealth and a large amount of technological gadgets often accessed and controlled through Holloway''s in-game smartphone. Typical actions include hacking phones for voice and text messages, changing traffic lights, disabling security systems, taking over camera systems, controlling cars, turning junction boxes into proximity mines  and so on. The quadrocopter is entirely new as a drone that can be flown to scout locations as often terminals need to be reached with puzzle sections before a hack is successful. Another type of drone is a remote-controlled car can be driven to hack terminals from a remote location. Hacking is also often a means to attack enemies from a distance, for instance by activating cars and driving them into opponents. Marcus has some acrobatic, parkour-like moves to get around.<br><br>Additional options become available through an upgrade system. There are three categories which fit different playstyles: Agressor, Ghost and Trickster. Holloway is able to issue fake warrants so random citizens are arrested in police actions. He can also lure gangs into wars to make a location less densely populated. When he attracts too much attention himself the police attempts to hunt him down. Money earned during missions can be spent in various ways, for instance by creating weapons through 3D printing. Many side missions and additional information can often be found by snooping on anyone walking around. Cars can be stolen or they are delivered using an phone app. Large distances can also be crossed using a fast travel system. There are optional eKart races, also rewarded with money and followers. Sailing and participating in races is supported as well. Holloway can be customized through a large amount of clothing options.<br><br>The single-player game morphs seamlessly in a multiplayer environment when there is an online connection. That means that other online players can be encountered at any moment. Players can choose to cooperate and work together on missions or they can hack each other. In the latter called invasions someone installs viruses on another player''s system and needs to complete the process and escape. The targeted player can win by locating or killing the hacker in the vicinity before time runs out. Players can also work together to neutralize other players causing havoc in a Bounty Hunter session.';

When his abilities come under the attention of the Department of Unified Protection (D.U.P.) and their leader Brooke Augustine, Delsin is faced to battle them head on in the streets of Seattle.  As a member of the Akomish Native-American tribe, Delsin knows there is nothing more important than your family. And thus he will do whatever necessary to protect them, even if it means becoming evil to do so.<br><br>Like the previous entries in the <i>inFAMOUS</i> series, <i>Second Son</i> is a 3rd-person action game that allows the player to choose between being a good or evil character.  You again play as a conduit, but this time you have access to a much greater variety of powers.  Across your playthrough, Delsin will have the chance to obtain four different powers, the first two being Smoke and Neon. Each power allows for a different playstyle and changes the dynamics of the game.  The Smoke power for instance is more aggressive and used for up-close combat while the Neon power is better situated for long-range, quick movement encounters. The player can unleash a powerful move called Karmic Overload once their karma power is maxed out.  Each of your powers can be upgraded by collecting blast shards all around the map.  Depending on whether you have good or evil karma, the player will be locked out of certain upgrades until there karma becomes the opposite.  Playing through the story gives access to a number of karma decisions where you have to make a good or evil decision usually involving another character, with your choice giving you an increase in that karma. <br><br>The game is open-world and allows movement across the whole city of Seattle.  There are side missions to complete and collectibles to find.  These side missions include spraying anti-D.U.P. images all over the city, finding and killing a secret D.U.P. agent, and searching for hidden audio files scattered around the area. The city is broken up into many D.U.P. controlled districts which can become less occupied by the enemy the more the player completes side quests.  After taking the districts down to 30% controlled by the D.U.P., you gain access to a District Showdown where you face off against a tough enemy opposition and winning that battle removes the D.U.P. from the area and gives access to a fast-travel spot.';

Helghast refugees who survived the catastrophic event known as "the Terracide" have been allowed by the ISA to live with them in a new futuristic city on the planet Vekta.  The two enemies are now separated by a large heavily guarded structure known as the Wall.  Taking control of ISA Shadow Marshal Lucas Kellan, your job to maintain peace between the two rival factions becomes tense as undercover operations to put an end to the war arise.  Armed with an immense hatred toward the Helghast, Kellan will stop at nothing to protect his planet and put an end to the threat, even willing to sacrifice anything to do so.<br><br>Gameplay in <i>Shadow Fall</i> is fairly similar to previous installments, though now with more improvements.  The game is much more open-ended allowing for multiple ways to reach your target and complete objectives.  The player is accompanied by a companion drone called the OWL which can help you in many different ways including deploying a zip-line or stunning the enemy. Using futuristic weapons and gear allows for new stealth gameplay.  The online multiplayer mode allows for up to 24-players to battle at once on any of the games default 10 maps. The level system is now challenge-based where completing any of the games many challenges will upgrade your rank.  Warzone returns as an online game mode along with Team Deathmatch and Beacon Retrieval (Capture the Flag). A new feature allows for the user to create Warzones with their own specific rules and share them with the community to download and play.';

	des := '<i>Bloodborne</i> is an action RPG that builds on the mechanics of the developer''s earlier games Demon''s Souls and the Dark Souls series. This title has Gothic and Victorian influences and it is set in the fantasy city Yharnam. The player''s character is one of the many travelers who go there to seek a cure for their ailments. The character creation process is a contract ledger at a clinic prior to a blood transfusion with the remedy. When the character wakes up it is discovered the entire city is overrun by an illness that has transformed the citizens into violent creatures. The character gets to explore the city in a non-linear way, meeting various inhabitants and defeating monsters to survive.<br><br>At the start a custom character can be created by defining a name, age, gender, origin and appearance. The starting statistics are a general starting level, starting blood echoes (the main currency), discovery (loot drop frequency), vitality, endurance, strength, skill, bloodtinge and arcane. The latter three influence who damages scales for certain builds. Origin replaces a general class system with different values for the statistics and a short back story. The available origins are Milquetoast, Lone Survivor, Troubled Childhood, Violent Past, Professional, Military Veteran, Noble Scion, Cruel Fate and Waste of Skin.<br><br>Early on in the game Hunter''s Dream is discovered, a location in another realm that acts as a central hub similar to The Nexus in <i>Demon''s Souls</i>. It is possible to warp there from the main game world after locating lamps. These lamps replace the bonfires of the previous games and it is still only possible to save at those locations. The hub has different messengers to buy and sell items, a workshop to upgrade and repair weapons, a storage for inventory management and a memory altar (through Caryll Runes). Through the Headstones of Awakening it is possible to warp to different parts of the world and Ritual Altars to access the Chalice Dungeons. These dungeons are randomly generated dungeons away from the main city players can explore. Layouts can also be shared or be found online. The two main characters in Hunter''s Dream are the wheelchair-bound Gehrman who provides advice and the life-size doll called Doll who helps leveling up. Next to the hub world it has the interconnect world known from the <i>Dark Souls</i> games.<br><br>Gameplay for combat, movement and exploration is largely similar to the <i>Souls</i> games. The weight statistic has been removed, there is less focus on defense and spells, and more on dodging. Rather than holding down a button, dodging is now an active and timing-based skill. The stamina bar is now more forgiving for multiple actions in succession. The amount of gear is more limited and the statistics are downplayed in favour of fighting skill for specific weapons. The main-hand weapon is generally melee while the off-hand usually holds a firearm mainly for combos and to riposte counter. An aggressive approach is rewarded through a new Regain system where certain attacks are rewarded with health after being hit, removing the need to run away and heal before continuing the fight. Generally health is restored through vials (found or purchased), replacing flasks in the previous games. Through the Insight stat enemy placement and attacks are influenced. Reaching a certain level also often brings new elements into the game world and changes how the world reacts to the protagonist. Some enemies are able to absorb souls, forcing you to reclaim them. Insights is also used as a currency to buy special items and required to summon other players. Next to the main weapons there are ten trick weapons, very powerful ones that have two forms that can be switched on the fly.<br><br>The online element is similar to the previous titles. Allies can be summoned in your world and it is possible to invade other people''s world. Up to three players can play cooperatively (not with private lobbies and passwords) and PvP is one-on-one. PvP is accessible after gaining an Insight rating of 30. Game elements include memoirs, asynchronous notes left behind, spectral appearances as illusions providing tips, and elements that show where other characters died.';

	des := '<i>Need for Speed</i> is the 20th main title in the racing series and a reboot of the franchise. It is an open world racing game set entirely at night that returns to the underground racing and tuning culture best known from the Need for Speed Underground series. The player is a new racer in the fictional city Ventura Bay and soon gets introduced to the local street racing scene, hooking up with the characters Amy, Manu, Robyn, Spike and Travis. The story is told through cut-scenes with full motion video combined with digitized sections, shown from the main character''s first-person perspective. Those five characters each aim to impress five real-life racing icons that are present as actors in the cut-scenes: Akira Nakai, Ken Block, Magnus Walker, Risky Devil and Shinichi Morohoshi. The player can follow five different paths with overlapping storylines and the goal is to make a reputation to challenge and beat these icons and become the new icon of Ventura Bay. The crew members regularly keep in touch through phone calls and text messages.<br><br>Next to cash earned in races up upgrade cars and buy new ones, REP is an important currency to progress in the game. With each new level new events are opened up. REP can be earned for five types of activities: Build (customization), Crew (social interactions and synchronized driving), Outlaw (illegal activities), Speed and Style, as well as through actions in the open world environment, especially by combining maneuvers. Each of the activities is tied to one of the five characters of the crew as well as an icon, and the player is free to pursue one the five paths in any order.<br><br>There is a lot of emphasis on tuning the licensed cars for the aesthetics, performance and handling. Many upgrades are based on parts that first need to be won or unlocked. The garage has room for five cars. Customization options include Paint  || CHR(38) || amp; Wrap to change an entire body kit or design each car element and decals in a custom way. There is also a Wrap Editor with many different types of paint jobs. Handling Tuning focuses most on the difference between drifting or opting for good grip. It is possible to upgrade a starter car to match the fastest ones in the game, so it is not required to sell and buy cars just to keep up. Racing is mainly arcade based and typical race types include standard races to reach the finish first (Sprint), drifting challenges and time based courses. Outlaw missions often include police chases and in some cases it is possible to pay the police a bribe so they halt the chase. There are also daily challenges.<br><br>The game requires a permanent internet connection at all times, even when playing solo. That also means the game cannot be paused during a race. The Autolog from previous titles, where scores and achievements are recorded and shared with friends, is still present. The online multiplayer continues the AllDrive concept of Need for Speed: Rivals. Instead of interacting with all online players, the game creates a lobby or copy of the game world where a maximum of eight online players are present. Participating in races is then done by starting or joining a crew. It is not a permanent organization and mostly resembles the idea of public and private matches. With each new game session a new crew needs to be started or joined, either privately with friends or for instance by joining a public crew. It is also possible to start a race and then bring in all friends of a crew.';

	des := '<i>Far Cry: Primal</i> is an open world action game set during the Stone Age in the fictional Oros Valley, in what is currently Central Europe. It takes place in 10,000 BCE, the beginning of the Mesolithic period. Unlike all previous games in the series no vehicles or modern weapons are available, only melee weapons such as clubs, axes and spears or short-ranged weapons such as bows. There are different types of ammo along with shards that can be used to poison enemies or make them go berserk. All of these need to be crafted by scavenging materials in the game world. Other game elements are learning to create and use fire (also to burn down parts of the environment), and hunting animals for food.<br><br>It is a time of great peril for the human race and the land is filled with dangerous predators such as sabretooth tigers and woolly mammoths. Animals still alive today such as tigers, leopards, wolves, bears and mountain lions are also present. The player controls Takkar, a member of the Wenja tribe, with the unique ability to tame wild animals. He must rebuild his village and unite the Wenja people against the flesh eating Udam tribe and the masters of fire of the Izila tribe. When the tribe becomes more popular, different types of upgrades for the village become available, tied to important tribe members such as the shaman, the hunter and the warrior. These upgrades then provide new quests, crafting options, and an expanded skill trees, one based on each character.<br><br>The game has a day-and-night cycle and the tamed animals can be used as companions in various ways, for instance to scout enemy camps, tag enemies, perform takedowns and drop bomb-like objects using the pet owl, riding animals and commanding them to attack. Later on different types of beast tamer masteries can be unlocked to upgrade the animals'' abilities. Rebuilding the village is the game''s main goal and there is no larger, overarching story beyond that. Returning from the previous game are enemy outposts that need to be captured and then can be used to fast travel, along with locations that have bonfires.';

You design a custom player and after five warm-up games you start undrafted in the middle of the season or a team. He has to prove his worth through short contracts (for instance about ten days) to get a full NBA career. There are different teams to choose from each with their own requirements and standards. The game assists players new to the sport by showing overlaying diagrams on the court that tell you where to move and through a voiced coaching system. There are RPG elements to the progress and communication with the team is important through the mentor system. The subtitled conversations of the previous game have been replaced with recordings and these include the voices of real players of different teams. Off-field interactions provide a narrative to the career, including offers, agents and rivalries. There is an upgrading system to earn virtual currency through endorsements, performance badges and completing challenges.<br><br>MyPark, called The Park in the previous edition, is the online streetball mode. You choose one of three cities and then play mostly two-on-two or three-on-three games against rival parks. You wait next to a field to assemble players and it is possible to join a crew to earn points that benefit everyone in the crew, while you receive a crew bonus. The moves of a player can be upgraded through dunk packages purchased through VC, the virtual currency. Large packs of this currency can be bought for real money. This mode uses the same player from the MyCareer mode, but here the focus is more on upgrading moves rather than spending the currency on performance boosts required for MyCareer. Real money can be spent on creating a distinct player through buying clothes. A fourth park called The Stage set on a rooftop is exclusive to the PS4 version of the game. It has the highest stakes for players to bet virtual currency on their matches. The PS4 version also comes with a 10,000 virtual currency bonus and a MyTeam card pack exclusive to PlayStation Plus members.<br><br>The MyGM mode returns where you manage an entire team. Unlike the previous edition this mode has been uncoupled from a required online connection, unlike most of the other game modes in this release. It is possible to play all games, but the focus is mostly on attracting new players, tracking their progress, determining tickets prices etc. There is also more focus on the conversations you have with the players as this has a distinct impact on their performance. MySeason is the game mode where you design a custom season with preferred teams. It also offers some European teams. MyTeam is the game mode similar to the Ultimate Team mode of the FIFA series where you collect card packs to assemble custom teams. You bet the cards in matches and by doing well you earn points to buy additional packs. You can also have your team compete against those of other players.<br><br>During gameplay an optional timer appears as a semicircle below a player''s feet when he is about to take a shot, providing assistance to get the timing right to improve accuracy, based on the timing, the player''s statistics and fatigue, combined with distance and positioning relative to the defending team. The game contains many new animation, a redesigned defensive AI, and more control over blocks, steals and rebounding. New to this edition is scanning technology. Using the Kinect or PlayStation Eye peripheral you can have your face scanned to receive a realistic rendition in the game.';

	des := '<i>Mafia III</i> is the third main game in the crime series with free-roaming gameplay combining fighting, shooting and racing, on foot and using vehicles. This time the protagonist is Lincoln Clay. He is a veteran of the Vietnam War and part of a black mob. The game is set in 1968 in New Bordeaux, a fictional environment inspired by New Orleans, which consists of ten districts. There are busy city environments, but also large stretches of swamps, the countryside, canals ... When circumstances force Clay to pay back a debt to the Marcano crime family, he is betrayed and his mob friends along with his surrogate father Sammy are all killed. Left for dead, he is rescued by his friend Father James and gets in touch with his former Vietnam CIA handler John Donovan. Clay is out for revenge to destroy the Marcano family and seize control of New Bordeaux. The story is told as flashbacks by survivors in different segments incorporating cut-scenes.<br><br>Next to the various missions there is a larger, faction/assets system where decisions influence the alliance with three important characters. There is Cassandra who leads the Haitian mob, Thomas Burke with ties to the IRA and the Italian gangster Vito Scalleta, the protagonist of Mafia II, who had to leave Empire Bay after killing the don Falcone. Lincoln is mostly on his own and needs their support to hold the territory he captures. Territory does not only provide an income, each faction assigned to it also provides different types of services such as muscle, providing cars and locations or arms dealers, sabotaging phone lines to prevent back-up, bribing the police etc. similar to a skill tree where new abilities are unlocked. A district is taken over after a number of rackets have been captured along with killing the capo who leads it. Each faction also provides a constant stream of missions in the open world with a cash reward.<br><br>As in the previous games there is free-roaming gameplay where any vehicle can be stolen and driven. Different types of gameplay styles are possible, involving melee fights or ranged gunplay, with brute force or using a stealth approach combined with a cover system. Using a wiretapping junction box or with the Inside Man bonus it is possible to eavesdrop and see enemies through walls using Clay''s Intel Vision, similar to the Eagle Vision of Assassin''s Creed. Enemies can be lured away by whistling. Missions include infiltration, killing targets, performing heists, destroying goods, stealing cars, intercepting drugs etc. Large buildings are often used for missions played inside that specific location. There is also a large amount of collectibles including different magazines, paintings and old album covers. Not all missions are scripted, some events are triggered based on actions in the environment or attacks by hit squads. When the police becomes involved, there is a blue search zone that needs to be escaped. NPCs will often report crimes and they can be killed to prevent this, but this often leads to a chain reaction.';

	des := '<i>Driveclub</i> is a road racing game combining both offline and online races, but with a global experience level for both. The game''s focus is on forming an online racing club with up to six racers in total. Each club member can race with a different car, but they can share emblems and decorations to distinguish themselves as a club. The score system ties the single-player performances to the online ones, where an entire club can benefit from a single player''s successes, also unlocking new vehicles and events with cars on loan for players not yet at the required level, even when not doing club races. As a club, players can sign up for an event and then race another group. It is not possible to design a custom event, these are provided by the developers. While racing players earn points for different actions such as drafting and gaining positions, but these can also be deducted for cutting corners, ramming into other vehicles or slamming into obstacles. For certain collisions the player is punished with a penalty of three seconds with limited speed. At the end of the race it does not matter which player reaches first place, it is the total team score that determines which club wins. The performance of other players in a club can be tracked through a social hub.<br><br>The gameplay mixes arcade elements with simulation, as players are rewarded for being patient, learning corners and takeover opportunities, and following the ideal racing line. However, bumping into other cars and cutting them off is also possible. Next to the offline single races against AI-controlled cars there is a single-player tour. It is a campaign with about fifty events divided over five levels unlocked gradually by completing challenges and earning stars by reaching a top place, doing a cornering challenge, maintaining a certain average speed or beating a certain time. There are 225 stars in total to earn and with set amounts new events are opened up. Next to star points, fame points can be earned for the global experience level, also affecting the club. Even when doing single-player there is a social link, as you can see challenges by other players and create your own after doing well in a race as a type of asynchronous multiplayer. It is possible to browse all existing challenges and by beating them both you and your club earn points.<br><br>The cars are licensed and divided into five classes: Hot Hatches, Sports, Performance, Super and Hyper. Cars are unlocked gradually by reaching a new driver level. They are based on four main statistics: acceleration, top speed, handling and drifting, but tuning is not possible except for determining the colour, coating and manual or automatic transmission. The tracks are inspired by locations around the world and generally there are three types of events: time trials, regular track races and drifting challenges.';

	des := '<i>Dying Light</i> is an open world, action horror game. It takes place in a zombie apocalypse environment, similar to the Dead Island games by the same developer. The game is set in the large city of Harran, with influences of ancient Turkey, overrun by a mysterious epidemic. The protagonist is Kyle Crane, an undercover GRE operative sent inside a quarantine zone. His initial mission is to neutralize the rogue GRE operative Kadir Sulaiman, but he can also choose to focus on helping the survivors instead. He can freely explore the city using parkour and freerun mechanics. The game has a dynamic day and night system  during the day zombies are less aggressive, so players can gather supplies, weapons, craft items etc. and prepare for the night, when infested are stronger and more dangerous.<br><br>The focus is on melee weapons and just like in <i>Dead Island</i> various materials can be crafted into weapons by gathering supplies. Also borrowed from that game is the stamina bar that prevents the character from continuously hitting. Guns can also be used, but sound attracts others. By progressing through the game the character''s abilities can be leveled up in the skill trees agility, power, and survival. There are often large groups of zombies that can be taken out from heights, by pushing them off, using projectiles or triggering traps. Instead of stealth there is more focus on escaping using the parkour mechanics. Unlike games such as Assassin''s Creed it requires precise timing and aim to grab ledges and combine slides and jumps into fluid movement.<br><br>Progress through the city is furthered by unlocking safe zones where zombies cannot enter. During the day Crane mainly needs to scavenge, locate and save survivors, explore, set up traps and locate air drops. At night the slow zombies become much more agile. They do more damage, can sprint and will chase Crane. Especially the Volatile creatures are extremely fast and deadly, changing the game''s pace with more focus on stealth as enemies will easily catch up. The game becomes harder, but experience points are doubled at night. Aside from traps, sound and distractions, UV light can be used to slow them down. There is also a dynamic weather system.<br><br><i>Dying Light</i> offers an online co-op mode for up to four players. In the Be the Zombie mode there is asymmetrical multiplayer where one player-controlled powerful Night Hunter can invade another player''s game at night and up to four players can work together to defeat it.';

	des := '<i>Battlefield Hardline</i> is a first-person shooter and the first game in the series to focus on urban crime instead of military warfare. The game is done by a different developer and the single-player portion of the game is split up into ten episodes modeled after an episodic TV series format, including a preview of the next episode at the end and a recap of the previous one when starting a new episode.<br><br>The game is set in Miami, Los Angeles, the deserts in California and many other locations around the world. They often offer a sandbox-like approach with multiple, non-linear options to complete objectives. The protagonist is the young detective Nicholas Mendoza who follows a drug supply chain with his partner Khai Minh Dao. The game mixes classic first-person shooter mechanics with non-lethal actions to resemble a realistic police approach, including stealth and the ability to hold criminals at gunpoint and flash a badge to perform an arrest rather than shooting them. The latter is also rewarded with more points. When enemies operate in groups it is often possible to lure one away. As a detective Mendoza can also use a scanner to locate evidence. These lead to separate cases that can be solved and clues are often divided over multiple episodes. When a case is solved a short conclusion cut-scene is shown, some more of the background story is revealed, and a new weapon or item is provided as a reward. The weapons in the single-player part are generally lighter than usual for the series. The pistol is the primary weapon and more powerful ones are generally unlockable assault rifles rather than military-grade machine guns. Throwables such as grenades are also not used. A taser can be used to subdue suspects without killing them. These are presented as Open Warrants, optional objectives to arrest with specific characters who also often carry evidence.<br><br>The multiplayer arsenal is more similar to Battlefield 4 with grenades, rocket launchers and heavy machine guns. There is a global ranking system based on experience. This is shown through French playing cards with over 150 different rank insignia. Coins are earned by completing specific objectives and for a number of coins a bounty is provided. Service Stars are provided for progression towards specific objectives, divided over multiple tiers. There are bronze, silver and gold stars and they provide additional weapon attachments and vehicle modifications, unique weapon parts and cosmetic appearances for the different classes. Assignments from the previous games also return, rewarded with new items, attachments and patches for completing general assignments. Syndicate assignments, similar to Phantom assignments in <i>Battlefield 4</i>, are harder to complete and provide additional weapons.<br><br>The four main classes in multiplayer games are largely similar to those in the previous game, but modeled after police and criminal forces. Enforcers are hard hitters with additional gadgets, Mechanics are able to repair vehicles, sabotage bombs and use a satellite phone to generate spawn points, Operators are light fighters with medical gadgets, and Professionals focus on intelligence and stealth with range attacks as well as cameras, decoys and mines. Next to the classic Team Deathmatch and Conquest game modes that support up to 64 players, five new multiplayer modes are available with two sides: law enforcement and criminals.<br><br>In Blood Money both sides need to retrieve money from a location in the center of the map and return it to an armored truck. The first team to deposit $5 million or to have the most money when time runs out wins. It is possible to steal from each other''s truck. Crosshair is played 5-on-5 with a single life for each player and a session that lasts three minutes. The criminals need to kill a VIP while law enforcement needs to secure the VIP to an extraction point. Heists has the criminals break into vaults or armoured trucks to bring crash to an extraction point while the police attempts to stop them. Hotwire is similar to the flags in Conquest, but they are replaced by drivable cars. Just like in Conquest the game is won by capturing them, but the cars need to be driven at a certain speed to reduce the reinforcement tickets for the other side. Up to four players can board a single car and while one drives the other three can lean out of the windows to shoot. The game is won by removing all opposing tickets or by having the most when time runs out. Just like Crosshair, Rescue is played 5-on-5 with sessions that last three minutes and players only have a single life. Law enforcement is represented by S.W.A.T. officers that need to free hostages or kill the criminals. The criminals win by killing all officers.<br><br>Vehicles are generally faster than those in the previous games. They include regular cars, jeeps, vans, trucks, tankers, bikes and different types of helicopters (scout, transport, fighters ...). By using a zipline to traverse between buildings various alternative approaches can be used. Next to the standard equipment pick-ups and additional weapons can be found while playing.';

	des := '<i>Dragon Age: Inquisition</i> is a role-playing game and the third main game in the <i>Dragon Age</i> series. It is set in the Thedas continent, the same fantasy world as the two previous games. It consist of two large countries: Ferelden (from Dragon Age: Origins) and Orlais, as well as the land inbetween. The story picks up after the events of the supplementary novels <i>Dragon Age: Asunder</i> and <i>The Masked Empire</i> describing a civil war in Orlais between the loyalists of the ruling Empress and a noble faction led by her cousin Grand Duke Gaspard. After the events of Dragon Age II  the Circle of Magi has gone rogue and the mages are at war with the Templar Order seceded from the Chantry. The player''s character enters the game world from the Fade, a breach to another dimension caused by an explosion at a peace conference between mages and templars. Many clerics, including their leader the Divine, are killed and initially the player''s character is held responsible for that, as the only survivor to come out of the blast. The character has however no memory of what has happened, but discovers powers that are capable of closing rifts as is then referred to as the Herald of Andraste. The initial premise is to close these rifts, with the help of the former associates of the Divine, Cassandra and Leliana, former templar Cullen and ambassador Josephine. Following the Divine''s last orders they establish the Inquisition, an independent group to close the rifts and bring those behind it to justice.<br><br>True to the spirit of the series the character can be customized for appearance, sex, class and race. The available races are dwarf, elf, human, and Qunari and the classes are mage, rogue, and warrior with three specializations each. To grow the Inquisition experience needs to be earned by completing quests, which allows the player to further define allegiances and pursue romances. A custom party can be defined and each member benefits from experience as it opens up access to better weapons and more abilities. Power points open up new areas and Inquisition points define the influence over the region; each new level provides a perk that benefits the entire Inquisition. The main hub for quests is the Inquisition''s war table. The War Council consists of Cassandra (also available as a party member), as well as Cullen, Josephine and Leliana. The latter three advisers can be assigned tasks to complete on their own to progress, unlocking new characters, quests and areas.<br><br>The party of four travels to different regions, mainly with the main goal to close a rift and defeat a rival faction, but there are also many sidequests not related to the main story, along with the allegiance towards templars or mages which offers separate missions, and character quests to please specific characters, often for romantic purposes. Each main mission has a recommended level to start and there are multiple difficulty levels. For combat the game can be played as an action RPG, controlling one character while the AI handles the other three, or using a more tactical approach. In the tactical mode the game is paused and orders can be issued. There are also many more details for enemies shown then, such as the HP, strengths and weaknesses. By holding a button the action can be started and as soon as it is released the game pauses again. Even when approaching it an an action RPG you still define the abilities of the other party members through skill trees and you can guide their general approach, such as aggressive or rather relying on defense. Weapon and equipment management through an inventory is also present as well as crafting based on recipes.<br><br>Multiplayer is available for up to four players, working cooperatively with quests separate from the single-player game, a first for the series. It is linked through the single-player game setting as the party members act as agents for the Inquisition. Also entirely new to the series is the introduction of optional micropayments to speed up progress, through the acquisition of the Platinum currency. Unlocked or crafted items cannot be transferred between the two game modes.';

The game has an overarching story for the first time, with voiced supporting characters and cut-scene sequences, and it is set in Bunkum where the familiar Sackboy character meets Newton. He tricks Sackboy into unleashing three Titans, creatures that were locked up because they robbed the world of creativity.<br><br>The goal is to explore three hub worlds where three heroes can be rescued: Oddsock, Swoop and Toggle. These all have different abilities and they can be used in some of the levels with puzzles specifically for that character and eventually they work together in the final levels of the game. Oddsock is a fast dog that is able to walljump, Swoop is a bird that can grab objects between its talons, and Toggle can switch between a light and heavy form, usually for pressure plates and weight based puzzles. As Little Toggle you can run over water and fit through tight spaces. Next to Sackboy''s basic controls there are a number of gadgets he can use, such as a helmet to glide rails, a ball that is launched using a Blink Ball gun to shiny surfaces to teleport there, the Velociporter to quickly move between foreground and background, Boost Boots to jump farther and a vacuum gun used to pull foam objects. Sackboy can also climb using rope-based textures that act like vines.<br><br>The game can be played cooperatively with up to four players, each controlling a character that can be extensively customized. Level environments are very different, including a stage set in a 50s diner, floating in a space level, a movie set, an Eastern European-Christmas-themed Ziggurat Hub, participating in a casino heist etc. Entirely new is the ability to complete levels by building contraptions using various items that have been collected.<br><br>As with the previous games it is possible to design and share custom levels. These are now introduced through a series of twelve Popit Puzzles in the Popit Academy, each training a specific technique or tool in level building. It is possible to build custom power-ups, starting with the Blaster Handle tool that can be fitted with various enhancements. The three layers of the previous game LittleBigPlanet 2 have been expanded to support up to sixteen layers. Levels support streaming and can be extended by stitchign them together. Custom levels have the ability to support more than one character during gameplay as well. Millions of levels created in the previous game are included straight away with the game and all previous content is compatible. There is also full compatibility for both platforms for content such as costumes bought for earlier versions of the game.';

	des := '<i>DOOM</i> is a reboot of the first-person shooter series and it consists of three parts, accessed and loaded separately from the main menu: a single-player campaign, multiplayer with different game modes, and the SnapMap editor where custom maps and game modes can be created and shared. While many elements of the series are revisited, the focus for this entry is on fast gameplay based on movement, fights switching between different weapon combinations, and violent gameplay with brutal finishers, more akin to the first games. Compared to DOOM³ the areas are wider with more focus on verticality and rewarding an offensive approach, doing away with the slower horror aspect based on scares.<br><br>The single-player campaign consists of thirteen levels. It is set on Mars on a research facility of Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC). The facility has been able to solve an energy crisis on Earth by channeling energy from Hell into a renewable power source called Argent energy. The flow is controlled through the construction of an Argent Tower, both harnessing the energy and providing a portal directly to Hell. When the player''s character, referred to as the Doom Marine, wakes up in a sarcophagus-like prison, a full invasion from Hell is already in progress. The initial goal is to push back the invasion with the assistance of UAC research chief Samuel Hayden. Later on the focus shifts to stopping Olivia Pierce who heads a cult that wants to use the energy of the Argent Tower to bring all demonic armies through the portal. The game takes place in the research facility and in Hell.<br><br>Typical movement includes (double) jumping and crouching. Many objects can be climbed and by jumping it is possible to hang from ledges and climb up quickly. After acquiring the Praetor Suit early on, many types of upgrades are unlocked gradually by collecting tokens. Suit upgrade categories include environmental resistance, area-scanning technology (also affecting the 3D automap), equipment system, power-up effectiveness, and dexterity. Weapons such as the plasma gun, shotgun, heavy assault rifle, rocket launcher, lightning gun etc. can be upgraded with different points also earned during combat. In addition floating combat support drones can be used to modify weapons, often adding secondary firing modes. Next to the regular selection all weapons can be accessed directly through a weapon wheel while time is slowed down. There is another upgrade system where power surges, found in locations, are used to permanently upgrade the maximum amount of health, armour and ammo. In a codex entries on monsters, weapons, artifacts and environments are stored. Many monsters typical for the series return in an updated form.<br><br>Level usually consists of multiple objectives with markers that point in the right direction. Many levels are very wide with multiple approaches and the typical coloured keycards are used to lock off sections. Next to weapons, ammo and armor, levels contain secrets, optional challenges for rewards, collectibles, health stations and data logs. An entirely new feature for the series is the glory kill system. Killing enemies provides a small amount of health, but larger amounts can be acquired through glory kills. When enemies receive a certain amount of damage they stagger with a blue highlight. When close enough they turn orange and a dynamic glory kill finisher can be performed, different based on the angle. These glory kills can often be used to chain attacks together. Melee attacks are also possible as well as using explosive items in the environment. The chainsaw weapon has a specific use. It requires fuel and does a lot of damage, with fuel consumption based on the strength of the enemy. A chainsaw kill is rewarded with additional ammo for the regular weapons. Through optional rune trials in levels a large number of runes can be earned that can be equipped in a small amount of slots.<br><br>Multiplayer game modes include team deathmatch (kill enemy players in teams), soul harvest (defeated enemies leave behind souls that can be harvested), domination, warpath (control moving zones), freeze tag and clan arena. Multiplayer has a global experience system providing hack modules and aesthetic customization as rewards. These modules provide perks such as timers, boosts of the ability to see through walls. There are loadouts based on classes such as assault, sniper and ambusher. Custom loadouts can also be unlocked and defined. Some game modes allow characters to pick up a pentagram and temporarily become a demon who floats in the air, has a lot of health and deals a lot of damage.';

	des := '<i>Just Cause 3</i> is the third main game in the action series set in an open world environment with a focus on shooting, causing destruction and over-the-top violence and stunts. The protagonist is once again the Mexican Rico Rodriguez. Set six years after the events of the previous game, Rico returns to Medici, the fictional Mediterranean island where he grew up until dictator General Sebastiano Di Ravello took control. The main story sees him team up with the scientist Dimah al-Masri and his former childhood friend Mario Frigo. They work for the rebellion who seek to overthrow Di Ravello and thwart his plans to take over the entire world. At first however, Rico needs to sabotage many operations and help to establish the rebellion''s influence, before the dictator can be taken on. Agent Sheldon from the previous game also returns.<br><br>As in the previous games Rico is in most situations able to do everything himself. Instead of following the main missions the islands can be explored without limits right away. The environment is now an archipel rather than a single island. Medici is divided into several regions, then further into provinces and even further into settlements. To liberate an entire province all settlements need to be freed. This is usually done by taking over (i.e. blowing up) a command centre, which is usually a large army base with heavy forces. There are also other activities to free a settlement, such as taking down billboards or statues, disabling propaganda messages or taking over the local police station. When all required activities are completed, the rebel flag is raised and the settlement has been taken over. Afterwards these can also be used for fast travel.<br><br>Rico can use any vehicle in the game such as cars, but also tanks, ships, fighter jets and attack choppers. After unlocking them, he can call in rebel supply drops to have a certain vehicle delivered. In some cases the AI adapts the difficulty level to match the chosen vehicle. Drops can also be used for weapons and equipment. There is no in-game currency. Important returning elements are the parachute to dive down and the grappling hook to quickly move through the environment or hitch rides. Many vehicles can be customized and be used as weapons, next to regular ranged weapons such as machine guns, rifles and missile launchers. Unlike the previous game C4 is now always available and with an infinite supply, but only five can be used simultaneously. Entirely new is the wingsuit as a means of transportation. The hook is also used to hook two items or vehicles, and then the cable is decreased to bring them together, often causing havoc. There are many upgrades to unlock, for instance making the hook much more effective and allowing more at a single time. Almost any action is recorded in online leaderboards for worldwide comparisons. There are also many challenges that encourage the player to experiment through mini-games and races.';

The player starts the game by choosing one of the 10 available classes, being able to customize the appearance of the character to their liking.

Also available is the regular host of weapons and armor to choose from, allowing for a very high level of replayability. The level design also remains true to the series, with several interconnected paths and secrets spread throughout. The covenant system is back along with the multiplayer mode, where players can interact in the same fashion as before, with invasions and co-op. One of the new additions to the game is the Weapon Arts system. This mechanic allows the player to have a specific stance for each of the weapons encountered in the game, being able to unleash a special movement with them by spending FP points (which are also used for casting magic, like in Demons Souls). This new system only adds to the depth of the game, paving the way for even more diverse character creation.';

	des := '<i>Black Ops III</i> is the fourth game in the <i>Black Ops</i> subseries (including World at War) of the <i>Call of Duty</i> first-person shooter franchise and the twelfth main title overall. It is the follow-up to Call of Duty: Black Ops II, but not a direct sequel. Rather, it continues the time progression of battles in the past in the first <i>Black Ops</i> game, modern and near future combat in the second game, and now a game in a far dystopian future set in 2065, 40 years after the previous title. A first for the series, the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions do not have the main single-player campaign, only the multiplayer portion and additional game modes such as Zombies. The single-player campaign is substantially longer compared to the previous games.<br><br>The game is set in the same universe as <i>Black Ops II</i> and references some past events indirectly. For instance, the focus in the story is back on group troops following the aftermath of the drone strikes by Menendez in the second game. Set in the far future, soldiers are now equipped with DNI, the Direct Neural Interface. It allows them to communicate directly with computers and machines, and it can also be used to read the thoughts and memories of people. The player controls a male or female character and needs the DNI after a failed infiltration and hostage rescue mission from the NCR in Egypt. Your partner, Jacob Hendricks, undergoes the enhancements as well. Five years later the player character and Hendricks are under the command of CIA Agent Rachel Kane investigating a CIA black site in Singapore. Through a series of events the player ends up in Egypt and Switzerland. The story deals with an artificial intelligence called Corvus, the role of privacy, the effects of cybernetic enhancements, secret CIA experiments, and also the characters Commander John Taylor and Dr. Yousef Salim.<br><br>Missions include linear first-person shooter levels with free movement as well as sections played shooting from a stationary position such as a vehicle. As the game is set in the future, various futuristic technologies are available. By progressing through the game new weapons and gadgets are unlocked. The most important ones are the new abilities called Cyber Cores and Cyber Rigs. Cores provide new abilities and attacks, while Rigs influence movement and agility, opening up powerslides, wallruns and boosted jumps. There are three types of Cores and only one can be equipped per loadout. They enable the player character to distract with decoy drones, boost the character in strength or speed, attack or take over robots or keep opponents occupied with swarms of bees. The campaign can be played cooperatively with up to four players.<br><br>The same abilities return for multiplayer, but there they are mostly enabled by default and the loadout centers more on the selection of weapons, items and the enhancements for weapons. The different types of killstreaks typical for the series return. Movement is very different and faster compared to earlier titles through wallruns and boosted jumps using thruster packs. This time multiplayer games are not played with a nameless soldier, but by choosing a specific Specialist, represented by a specific class. They each have a callsign, a distinct look, a unique weapon and a unique ability. Four are available right away and the other ones are unlocked gradually. The Specialist classes available at the launch include Battery, Nomad, Outrider, Prophet, Reaper, Ruin, Seraph, Spectre. Ruin for instance has access to Gravity Spikes as a special weapon and Overdrive with enhanced speed as an ability. In certain matches players can vote to protect (keep) or ban certain Specialists, weapons and abilities. The Pick Ten system for custom loadouts from the previous game is still present. Guns can be customized through the Gunsmith feature, for both form and function.<br><br>Unlock tokens are a new element. They are needed to unlock new weapons, attachments, equipment and killstreak awards. They are earned by completing challenges and leveling up. Another type of tokens is used to trade at a Black Market to receive packages with a selection of common or rare items. Many game modes return, such as Domination, Gun Game, Hardpoint, Kill Confirmed, Search  || CHR(38) || amp; Destroy and Uplink. There are no new player-versus-player multiplayer game modes. Typical for the <i>Black Ops</i> series is the Zombies game mode with separate storylines. This time it includes an experience system, and special abilities and power-ups can be selected in the loadout. These power-ups can be bought at the Zombies version of the Black Market or through a chewing gum machine. Also new for that mode is the use of altars that temporarily turn the player character into a powerful creature. Levels contain short-cuts that can only be accessed while in creature form. The Zombies mode is now set in Morg City and introduces four new characters: Nero the Magician, Jessica the Femme Fatale, Vincent the Cop and Campbell the Boxer.<br><br>Another new game mode is Freerun where players can run through obstacle courses using the new abilities to get the fastest times. When the regular campaign is finished, the Nightmare campaign is unlocked. It remixes the original campaign with different enemies such as zombies, random weapons instead of loadouts, and the use of power-ups.';

	des := '<i>Grand Theft Auto V</i> takes place five years after Grand Theft Auto IV and is now set in Los Santos. It centers around three protagonists: Michael, Trevor and Franklin. New to the series is that the player can switch between the three characters on the fly. They each have different missions, lives and personalities. They also often come together, especially for heists, a complex type of mission where a large operation needs to be planned and executed by determining a strategy and hiring additional henchmen. As with previous games in the series, the gameplay involves gunfights and takes place in a sprawling, open world city where players get around by acquiring transport (cars, boats, helicopters, etc) through less than legal means. Players can roam the game world, complete story missions and partake in various illegal activities, including shooting civilians, robbing people, destruction of cars and the titular act of car theft. These lead to a wanted rating of up to five stars, sending in a police force in pursuit. Continuing to resist the police will also increase it. The wanted status is lost by getting out of sight or by spraying the car.<br><br>Michael, whilst hiding in the witness protection program as a result of a botched robbery nine years earlier, encounters Franklin who, in his capacity as a repo man, is sent to get a car from Michael''s son Jimmy. Michael however realises Franklin is being set up, so tells Franklin to crash his sons car into the dealership who sent him. After that, they become friends. One day, Michael discovers his wife in bed with another man, and with Franklin''s help, chases him to a mansion, which they promptly burn to the ground. The mansion, unfortunately, belongs to Mexican drug lord Martin Madrazo, who demands they compensate him for what they did. They successfully rob a jewelry store, and one of Michael''s old partners Trevor hears of this, and asks to team up with the other two, who agree. From here their lives begin to spiral out of control.<br><br>The game''s multiplayer component is called <i>GTA Online</i>. It is set two months before the start of the single-player story. It allows up to 16 players (PS3 / Xbox 360) or 30 players (Xbox One / PS4 / PC) to travel around a world identical to the single-player world to complete story-driven activities, both competitive and co-operative.<br><br>The later released PS4, Xbox One and PC versions have various enhancements and additional features. Technical upgrades include an increased draw distance and support for higher resolutions. New content includes new weapons, vehicles and activities, additional wildlife, denser traffic, a new foliage system, enhanced damage and weather effects. The Dodo is a classic <i>GTA</i> seaplane, there are stock car races with additional liveries, a new Imponte Duke O''Death vehicle, the Marshall Monster Truck, and the Xero Blimp. There are new shooting challenges and new weapons such as the rail gun and hatchet. New wildlife photo challenges let players unlock the Kraken submarine. A new murder mystery can be solved to unlock film noir game filters. Monkey Mosaics are a new collectible to unlock monkey outfits and Monkey Blista. There are also 100 additional songs divided over the 17 existing radio stations. The most distinct new feature is a full first-person view for the entire game, allowing the player to shoot, walk and drive from that perspective. This comes with entirely new animations for the view, showing the hands when entering cars or in melee fights, and vehicles have fully functional interiors, HUDs and interfaces.';

	des := '<i>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</i> is the eleventh main game in the first-person shooter series. The single-player campaign is set in the future, around 2054, when Atlas, a private military corporation led by Jonathan Irons, has become the most powerful military organization on the planet. The player controls Jack Mitchell who starts as a soldier for the Marine Corps. He is stationed in Seoul, South Korea, with Will Irons. In a successful, but deadly mission against North Korea, 6.000 marines are killed including Will and Jack loses his left arm. At the funeral he is approached by Jack''s father Jonathan who offers his a job at Atlas and where he receives a high-tech prosthetic arm. The story covers several years and locations as Atlas'' intentions are slowly revealed. Next to Irons prominent characters are Gideon, Joker, Ilona, and his old sergeant Cormack. Countries and locations visited in the game include U.S.A., Greece, Bulgaria, Nigeria, South Korea, Thailand, Antarctica, and Iraq.<br><br>As the game is set in the future, Mitchell has access to high-tech exosuits that drastically enhance the soldier''s abilities. Each mission provides a different type of suit with specific powers, such as the ability to double jump, use a grappling hook, hover through boosts, become invisible through cloak, launch grenades, provide a shield or additional health, and climb metallic surfaces. Compared to other <i>Call of Duty</i> games, there are more moments with slower action, the opportunity for stealth and a number of environments that are more open so different approaches can be considered. Mitchell can be upgraded by earning points through completing challenges, allowing him to reload faster or to take more damage. Various missions provide vehicles, such as a hoverbike, a speedboat with the ability to plunge underwater, heavy mech suits, a tank, and a fighter jet. The game does not use a regular HUD, but all information is projected on the weapon through a hologram. Next to regular weapons and grenades there are weapons that rely on lasers or energy.<br><br>For multiplayer game modes include Capture the Flag and Hardpoint (returning from Call of Duty: Black Ops II), the flag based Momentum (based on the War game mode from Call of Duty 3 and Call of Duty: World at War), Domination, Kill Confirmed and others. Entirely new is the objective based Uplink mode based on carrying satellites with two teams of four to six players. The loadout is called the Pick 13 system, a variation of the <i>Black Ops II</i> Pick-10 Create-A-Class system. Players have room for thirteen items or abilities, such as a primary weapon with different attachments, different perks, scorestreak rewards etc. Scorestreaks can be customized, a first for the series, but it makes the reward more expensive. There are also regular supply drops that provide items in three categories: enlist (common), professional (uncommon), and elite (rare). These include custom weapons and customization items called reinforcements. All collected items are stored in an armory, but they can also be exchanged for additional experience instead. Just like in single-player the exosuit abilities can be used, and some of them such as boost and the grappling hook alter the movement significantly.<br><br>Like many of the previous games there is another, separate game mode, now called Exo Survival, very similar to the ones from Call of Duty: MW3 and Call of Duty: Ghosts. One to four players work together to survive multiple rounds, fighting off waves of enemies. There are four tiers to unlock and eleven rounds in total.';

	des := '<i>Halo 5: Guardians</i> is a first-person shooter, the fifth main game in the futuristic <i>Halo</i> series. It is the second game in the Reclaimer Saga, a new sub-series created by 343 Industries after they took over development from original <i>Halo</i> developer Bungie. The game is set in 2558, eights months after the events of the Spartan Ops game mode of Halo 4. The game''s story relies strongly on the player''s knowledge of the lore, past events and spin-offs and does not rehash what has happened before.<br><br>The main campaign consists of fifteen levels that can be played alone or with up to four players online with drop-in/drop-out multiplayer and four difficulty levels. It is played from the alternating perspectives of two Spartan fireteams. The first one, the Spartan-II Blue team, consists of Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, Linda-058 (sniper), Kelly-087 (scout) and Fred-104 (CQB Specialist). The second one, the Spartan-IV Osiris team is led by ONI agent Jameson Locke and consists of Holly Tanaka (engineer), Vale (pilot and translator) and Edward Buck (trooper). When playing alone the team mates can be issued commands to attack specific targets or to move to certain locations. They will also revive the player character when down. In cooperative multiplayer each player can freely choose and control a team character with specific skills and weapons. The game opens with the Osiris team eight months after the destruction of the shield world Requiem. They need to infiltrate enemy lines to extract the criminal Doctor Elizabeth Halsey who wishes to defect back to UNSC and has information about a new threat. Meanwhile the Blue team investigates the ONI research station Argent Moon that has been occupied by The Covenant. After a series of events the Blue team goes rogue, disobeying orders, and the Osiris team is ordered to hunt them down as a larger plot unfolds with the Forerunners as the main enemy.<br><br>The game has a linear design, with several open areas linked together, combined with scripted sequences. Although played entirely from the UNSC side the game is designed in such a way that the player often needs to use weapons and technology of the Covenant and Forerunners as well. During missions, optional collectibles such as skulls and mission intel can be picked up. The gameplay focus for this title is on faster mobility. Next to many different vehicles and turrets that can be manned by the team, the armor abilities have been replaced by Spartan abilities. They provide a thruster pack with a boost that can be used for omnidirectional movement both on land and in the air. A character can dash, quickly vault ledges and jump into cover. Sprinting is still present with charge and slide abilities, but shields do not regenerate while sprinting. A first for the series is iron sights while aiming called a "smart scope" in the game. Next to grenades and ranged weapons there is a melee attack and a move to slam enemies down into the ground.<br><br>The main new multiplayer mode is Warzone. It supports matches with up to 24 players, optionally combined with AI characters, as a tug-of-war with many missions in succession on a very large map. Other, more regular game modes are Arena (traditional deathmatch types), Team Arena (with variants of capture-the-flag, stronghold and team deathmatch), Breakout (one life), SWAT (no shields or radar) and Slayer (free-for-all). Optionally games with custom rulesets can be created and dedicated servers are used. The game has microtransactions with real money in Warzone for power-ups and single-use vehicles or weapons. There are also cosmetic upgrades with new (weapon) skins and animations, helmets, visors and emblems, and money can be used to pay for experience boosts to level up quicker. Almost everything can also be unlocked or gained through regular gameplay by earning enough of the currency.';

	des := '<i>Battlefield 1</i> is the fifteenth main game in the <i>Battlefield</i> shooter franchise and as a main entry the follow-up to the 2013 Battlefield 4. This time it is set during World War I and it is inspired by the historic events. Like most of the main games in the series it combines a single-player campaign with an extensive amount of multiplayer modes. The campaign consists of six large missions, dubbed War Stories, each with a different protagonist, a different setting and distinct gameplay elements. The prologue "Storm of Steel" is experienced through the eyes of several Harlem Hellfighters in France and "Through Mud and Blood" is about controlling a tank in France as a British driver. "Friends in High Places" takes it to the skies in France and England as a fighter pilot for the Royal Flying Corp and in "Avanti Savoia" you are a member of the Arditi in Italy. In "The Runner" you are an ANZAC runner in Turkey and the final story "Nothing is Written" is about controlling a Bedouin warrior commanded by Lawrence of Arabia in Mesopotamia. Each story has a different approach and offers specific vehicles, weapons or play styles.<br><br>Multiplayer usually supports 24, 32 or 64 players on a single map depending on the game mode and most of these are based on the settings of the single-player War Stories. The game was launched with nine multiplayer maps: Amiens, Argonne Forest, Ballroom Blitz, Empire''s Edge, Fao Fortress, Monte Grappa, Sinai Desert, St. Quentin Scar, and Suez. There are seven game modes: Air Superiority, Conquest, Domination, Operations, Rush, Team Deathmatch, and War Pigeons. Rush, Conquest, Team Deathmatch, and Domination all return from <i>Battlefield 4</i>. Air Superiority was introduced in Battlefield 3: End Game.<br><br>War Pigeons is a team based mode where up to 24 players need to work together to locate pigeons. Once captured, a pigeon needs to be held and defended by the team, while the other team attempts to kill that player. While it is held, a message is being written and once completed the pigeon is released and the message provides the location of the enemy forces for the friendly artillery to rain down on them. The team then receives a point. Pigeon progress is sustained when it is dropped. It can also be shot when it is released and in the air, denying the point and artillery. The message is written the quickest by standing still; shooting and moving slows down the writing.<br><br>The Operations game mode builds on the concept of Rush with offence and defense. The map is split up in sectors the offensive side needs to secure. When both control points of a sector are captured, they own the sector. This goes on for several sectors until a final one is captured, but the attackers have limited respawns. The main difference is that the game takes place across several maps and the back-and-forth is turned into a large military campaign where one environment continues where the previous one ended. Attackers only have three waves to capture all maps to win the entire match. The limited respawns can be countered by using medics and the attackers receive special vehicles that allow for a big push forward. Every map has a specific type: Airship L30 (zeppelin), Armored Train, or Dreadnought (naval vessel).<br><br>Multiplayer has eight distinct classes: Assault, Cavalry, Elite, Medic, Pilot, Scout, Support, and Tanker. A new element is the introduction of a persistent squad where a team of up to five players can remain together as a single unit, even when moving between different servers. Warbonds is the in-game currency used to buy items and gear. There are many authentic weapons such as artillery, flamethrowers, hand guns and small arms, machine guns, many types of rifles, shotguns and mustard gas. Gas can countered by wearing a mask, but this limits both hearing and viewing. Weapons have many types of customization options. There is also a large amount of melee weapons divided in two groups to support the trench based combat including bayonets, clubs, sabres and shovels. Armed vehicles include aircraft, battleships tanks, trucks, and zeppelin. It is also possible to ride a horse into battle.';

	des := '<i>Fallout 4</i> is an open world role-playing game in the style of its predecessors, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. Returning gameplay features include the ability to switch between first-person and third-person perspectives, an open world with free roam exploration, a variety of combat options (including guns, explosives, unarmed, and melee), numerous sidequests along with a more linear main questline that branches toward its conclusion, dialogue options that influence the route of a conversation, and the selection of companions that aid in battle. <br><br>The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skill system also makes a return, allowing the player to decide the importance of certain skills to their character (S.P.E.C.I.A.L. being an acronym for Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck) upon leveling up. The function of perks is altered, as they are now attached to a skill tree with availability dependent on the rank of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skills that they''re associated with. The Intense Training perk is replaced by the optional ability to improve the rank of any one of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skills by leveling up, in the place of selecting a perk. The Pip-Boy can be acquired early on, and provides access to the player''s statistics, inventory, maps, and quest information as in previous games, with the added function of playing mini-games that can be found throughout the Commonwealth. The player can also make use of the Pip-Boy app in order to access the Pip-Boy menu, rather than using the in-game function. HP (health points) and AP (action points) make a return as primary statistics, with the removal of weapon and armor condition. Stimpaks, beds, and other types of consumables such as water or TV dinners can be used to restore HP. Unlike in previous games, exposure to radiation directly influences the player''s max health, and can only be reduced through RadAway or paid assistance from a doctor. AP restores over time, and can be used to sprint or attack using the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.), slowing down time and giving the player the ability to select a target with success in combat dependent on accuracy, which itself is dependent on factors such as weapon range, distance of the target, and obstruction of the target. <br><br>New features include the absence of a level cap, allowing the player to completely max their skills and acquire all perks, fully-voiced male and female protagonists, and an expansive crafting system. The player can cook food, craft drugs, add a wide variety of modifications to weapons and armor, and construct functioning settlements. Settlements may be provided with food, purified water, power, defense systems, housing, and shops that attract merchants and settlers. The player can obtain materials for building by collecting objects that may be deconstructed throughout the wasteland (classified in the Pip-Boy as "junk") or deconstructing unneeded objects, such as collapsed houses or fallen trees, all of which can be placed in the workshop for later use.<br><br>The story of <i>Fallout 4</i> begins in 2077, in an alternate retro-futuristic timeline that diverged from that of the real world following World War II. In favor of miniaturization of electronics, the world''s governments have focused on developing nuclear energy as a power source, which has led to the creation of power armor, laser weaponry, and housekeeping robots. However, despite these technological advancements, the world is in a state of crisis, as resources are scarce and nuclear war is imminent. During this time, the customizable player character lives a peaceful life in a suburban neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts with their spouse and infant son. However, the peace is interrupted when a Vault-Tec representative knocks on the family''s door. The man informs the player character that their family has recently been approved for entry into the nearby Vault 111, one of many vaults constructed by Vault-Tec as shelter against the threats of a nuclear holocaust. This visit is closely followed by a news report of a nuclear attack, giving the family no other choice but to take shelter in Vault 111, where they are tricked into a state of cryosleep. 210 years later, in the year 2287, the player character emerges from the vault, beginning their journey into a post-apocalyptic wasteland.';

	des := '<i>Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare</i> is the thirteenth primary installment in the annual first-person shooter series. It continues the futuristic direction of the previous games, now introducing combat in outer space along with fights in zero-gravity environments. As usual it combines a single-player campaign, a zombies game mode and a full multiplayer mode.<br><br>The single-player campaign is set in a distant future where most of Earth''s natural resources have been depleted. Through the population and industrial expansion, United Nations Space Alliance (UNSA) is established as a political organization to handle and negotiate all aspects of human space colonization. Different organizations attempt to control the colonies, most notably Solar Associated Treaty Organization (SATO) which is opposed by the hostile faction Settlement Defense Front (SDF). The game focuses on the moment when SDF attacks UNSA, severely weakening its defenses on Earth. The protagonist is Tier 1 Special Operations pilot Captain Reyes, part of the military outfit Special Combat Air Recon (SCAR) tasked with defending UNSA. Only two major warships survive the attack and Reyes is on one of them called Retribution. As one of the few surviving officers he soon receives command of the vessel which then acts as a central hub.<br><br>The different missions often stress a guerrilla approach with stealth elements against the much stronger SDF. In space this is done through sneaky light speed jumps. Most of the SDF opposition consists of drone soldiers. There are also aerial combat dogfight missions in space with free movement using a smaller fighter ship called Jackal. From the main ship''s bridge both primary and optional missions can be started, with the latter called Ship Assaults unlocking new perks, weapons and gear. A notable side character is Ethan, a fighter drone with a personality. Reyes can use a grappling hook to navigate zero-gravity environments combined with boosts. He also has a wrist computer to control machines and hack enemy gadgets. The campaign introduces two new difficulty modes: Specialist and #YOLO. In the first Reyes'' movement can be affected when he is shot in the legs, he can shoot weapons out of the hands of opponents and health regeneration is only possible through nano shots. The other one, #YOLO, introduces permadeath instead of restarting at checkpoints.<br><br>Online multiplayer continues many gameplay elements and mechanics introduced in the previous game Call of Duty: Black Ops III. This is apparent in the fast chain-based movement with slides, wallruns and boosts based on different Combat Rigs replacing the class system. The six Rigs are FTL, Merc, Phantom, Stryker, Synaptic and Warfighter. They each provide different options for different play styles. Permanent perks called Traits can be used in addition. Returning game modes are Domination, Hardpoint and Kill Confirmed. Two new ones are Defender and Frontline. Defender is a game about controlling a ball-shaped drone, combining Hardpoint and Uplink gameplay. Frontline is a more traditional team deathmatch mode where double points are scored for kills outside the home base where an armour bonus is provided.<br><br>New types of weapons are often energy based and there are Black Hole grenades that can temporarily alter gravity. The primary and secondary weapons have attachments and there is a new crafting system. Points earned during matches can be salvaged to access prototype weapons. That way four prototype versions of a gun can be acquired, ranked Common, Rare, Legendary or Epic. Each weapon provides different advantages called Gun Perks. Combat Rigs provide special weapons called Payload. They include the ability to briefly turn into a predator animal or the Claw as a weapon with bouncing bullets. The main ranked multiplayer is centered around the league play with a World League. Most of the special weapons can be acquired through keys used to open loot crates. They can also be bought right away with real money.<br><br>The cooperative zombies game mode has a humourous 1980s setting based on the premise of four actors. They think they audition for a movie, but end up is a creepy theme park where the director toys with them. Players earn weapons and break through barricades to access new parts of the park in multiple rounds attempting to survive as long as possible. New elements are a robot that can be helped to receive support troops and using the environment in creative ways to get rid of the zombies. There is no space combat in this mode, but the perks and power-ups are kept. Fate and Fortune cards are a new element, earned with every new level, similar to the Gobblegums in <i>Black Ops III</i>.<br><br>Special editions of the game are bundled with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare - Remastered, a remastered version of the 2007 title Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. On this site that game is documented at the game entry Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare (Legacy Edition). The Windows 10 version of the game does not have cross-platform multiplayer with the regular Steam PC version.';

	des := '<i>Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare</i> is an online only, class-based, third-person shooter with a tongue in cheek approach to modern day shooters as the title implies, referring to the Modern Warfare series.  While the game does take place in the Plants vs. Zombies universe it vastly diverts away from the tower defense genre and instead puts the players in the shoes (or roots) of either zombies or plants in all out warfare.<br><br>Each side has four different classes with their own unique abilities and strengths:<br><br><ul><b>PLANTS</b><li><i>Peashooter:</i> Very fast and agile and can take moderate damage.  Their abilities include being able to root in place and unleash a torrent of peas at opponents, the ability to run and jump at incredible speeds and a chili bean bomb with can devastate any opponent caught within the blast radius.</li><br><li><i>Sunflower:</i> The medic of the team, they have lesser firepower and armor but can revive any downed ally quickly and can use a healing beam which can quickly restore health.  Other abilities include being able to root and unleash a beam of concentrated sunlight to damage opponents and being able to drop a potted healing plant which can heal any allies within it''s radius.</li><br><li><i>Cactus:</i> They are the snipers of the team, firing needles at medium to long ranges they can also release drones which can rain down corn strikes down onto opponents, barriers to slow zombies down and potato mines that can quickly defeat anyone foolish enough to step on them.</li><br><li><i>Chomper:</i> The heavy, they are slow and cumbersome but they can quickly defeat opponents by chomping them from behind and gulping them down with one bite, however this leaves them vulnerable to attack until they digest their prey.  They can also burrow underground and unleash a surprise attack and set up vine traps that ensnare anyone who steps in them.</li><br><br><b>ZOMBIES</b><li><i>Soldier:</i> The all around class, they can use a rocket to jump onto higher places such as cliffs and roofs, throw Zombie Stick Clouds with can disorient plants caught within them and damage them and a ZPG which unleashes devastation, especially to rooted plants.</li><br><li><i>Scientist:</i> The medic of the zombies they can use healing stations to restore health and can quickly revive downed allies.  They can also use warping abilities to get out of situations fast and use a sticky bomb which can be used to set up traps for wayward plants.</li><br><li><i>Engineer:</i> While a bit slower they can use a jackhammer ability to quickly transverse the battlefield as well as build teleporters scattered on select modes for zombie allies to get around faster.  They also have sonic grenades which can stun plants and quickly force any Chomper burrowing underground and can use a Zombie Drone to unleash road cone strikes.</li><br><li><i>All-Star:</i> The heavy of the zombies, they can take much more punishment and dole out more but also are a bit slower.  All-Stars can deploy shields that can absorb damage and use imp punts to take out groups of plants as well as a sprint tackle that can knock out opponents caught within its path.</li></ul><br><br>There are also different variations of each class which can give them different weapons and the ability to have elemental damaging effects and also an alternate version of their abilities which can be used more often but less as effective as their default abilities.  Players can unlock these classes and abilities by completing games and challenges and earning coins to buy card packs which can be opened to unlock these abilities and classes as well as A.I. reinforcements which players can summon in certain modes as well as new costume pieces used to customize the plant/zombie.<br><br>There is a 4-player co-op mode called Garden Ops (another play on Modern Warfare''s Spec Ops) in which up to four friends or strangers can team up and defend their garden against 10 waves of A.I. zombies.  After wave five and ten, the players will have a boss fight which is determined by a slot machine which can produce multiple generic zombies but also stronger boss zombies that will take much more damage.<br><br><br>The other modes are competitive which include:<ul><li><b>Welcome Mat:</b> A basic team deathmatch in which players start out with default classes as well as abilities and each time they are vanquished they are given a health boost.</li><li><b>Team Vanquish</b>: A standard team deathmatch where the team with 50 vanquishes win the match.</li><li><b>Gardens  || CHR(38) || amp; Graveyards</b>: A mode where plants defend gardens against zombies with the goal of the zombies to stay within a predetermined area around the garden.  If zombies outnumber plants they can quickly turn it into a graveyard, doing so before the time limit is up will increase the timer and unlock the next area until areas are conquered or the plants can hold off the zombies for a certain amount of time.</li><li><b>Classic Team Vanquish</b>: Team deathmatch but with default classes and abilities.</li><li><b>Classic Gardens  || CHR(38) || amp; Graveyards</b>: The same mode but with default classes and abilities.</li><li><b>Mixed Mode</b>: A mix of modes and maps that randomly cycle through.</li></ul><br><br>Later updates brought new class variations and maps as well as other game modes:<ul><li><b>Gnome Bomb</b>: In which a bomb strapped Gnome is placed on either the plant''s gardens or the zombie''s tombstones.  If they are not disarmed they will destroy it and continues until either the time runs out or one side blows up all three areas.</li><li><b>Vanquished Confirmed!</b>: A take on Kill Confirmed in which players only gain points through picking up orbs dropped by vanquished players.</li><li><b>Suburbination</b>: Another take on a Call of Duty mode, Domination, where players via for three separate points of interests, controlling them causes the enemy team to lose faster.</li><li><b>Taco Bandits</b>: Where plants must defend their taco stand from marauding zombies bent on grabbing them and taking them back to their base.  The game is over either when time runs out or if zombies return a taco three times.</li></ul><br>As a result of the online only nature of the game, Xbox 360 and Xbox One owners are required to have a Gold Membership in order to play the game.  Also PC players are required to have an Origin account through EA to play.';

	des := '<i>Evolve</i> is an asymmetrical multiplayer game for five players. It is played with a team of four humans against a single monster, all controlled by human players. It does not contain a separate single-player mode, but the game can be played by a single player with up to four bots controlling the remaining spots. The game is set in the future and takes place at Shear, a planet far away that has been colonized. The valuable colonies are soon attacked by different kinds of monsters. To deal with the threat, war veteran William Chabot is brought out of retirement and he assembles a team of hunters to eliminate the monsters.<br><br>The human side consists of four classes. There are Assaults (damage), Medics (health), Supports (tools) and Trappers (Tracking). Players assemble a team with any combination of the classes to hunt down the monster. There are multiple characters per class with different secondary skills and abilities and each class has different general abilities. Assaults use a personal shield for temporary invulnerability, Medics use health burst to provide health in a radius, Supports can activate a radius of cloaking, and Trappers use a Mobile Arena energy dome shield to narrow down the area where the monster can be found. Secondary skills are different for each character. Hunter Abe for instance has a track dart gun to track monsters or tag food (which marks the monster when it is consumed). The other Hunter Griffin can deploy spikes to detect and movement and the Hunter Maggie releases a pet trapjaw to chase after the monster''s trail. Next to the permanent perk and the basic customization system, the full roster of characters is unlocked by reaching the mastery level for the skills. This can also be done in solo matches and it applies to the monsters as well.<br><br>There are three types of monsters to choose from. Goliath is a durable melee monster. It can charge, use its fire breath, and perform a leap smash or a rock throw. Kraken is a flying monster that attacks from long range using electricity. It has access to aftershock (energy burst), banshee mines, lightning strike and vortex. Wraith is a stealth monster. It uses abduction to get a character away from the team, can create a decoy version of itself, create a supernova (radial destruction along with damage and attack speed buff), and perform a warp blast to teleport and do damage at the same time. Additional characters and monsters are included in special editions of the game or can be bought as DLC. They do no split the community as players who do not own the DLC can still fight the additional characters and monsters, but cannot play them. Additional maps are released for free for all players.<br><br>Monsters can feed on wildlife and dead humans to fill an energy meter and evolve. This is used to become stronger, but to evolve they have to enter a cocoon stage for a while that leaves them very vulnerable. Wildlife can attack both sides, influencing the events, and can reveal locations. Both sides can use different types of power-ups and need to use a strategic approach to overcome the opposition.<br><br>The game modes are Defend, Hunt, Nest and Rescue. In Defend the humans need to defend a starship''s refueling station by protecting power generators until the ship is fully refueled. The opposition controls a single, fully evolved monster, along with various Goliath minions. The monster must destroy the two generators to reach the ship''s power source before it is refueled. In Hunt the monster wins by killing all humans or by evolving to stage three to destroy a power relay, while the humans merely need to destroy the monster. The monster receives a head start to get away before the humans are dropped. When the monster dies the game is over immediately. When a hunter is killed there is a wait time of three minutes before respawning. In Nest the monster needs to defend six monster eggs somewhere in the environment for ten minutes. The eggs can be hatched to receive help from minions. Humans have ten minutes to destroy all eggs. In Rescue both the humans and the monster go after injured colonists spread over the map. The first to rescue or kill five respectively, wins the session.<br><br>Games can be played as Quick Play sessions or in the Evacuation story mode. In the second type each won match in a cycle of five brings an advantage to the next map for that side and it ends with a Defend match. There are different types of maps with distinct themes such as a jungle or using industrial elements.';

When humans first set foot on Mars they discovered the Traveler, a giant sphere that then allowed mankind to colonize space quickly. Centuries later the Darkness, an enemy of the Traveler, arrived and waged war against it and all of its creations. The Traveler is forced to scarify itself as a measure of protection and what is left of humanity on Earth is forced to live in a city constructed underneath. The Traveler enlists warriors known as Guardians with special abilities as a personal army. These Guardians are guided by Ghosts, artificial intelligence. The player''s character is found by such a Ghost (acting as a robot companion in the game) and becomes a Guardian.<br><br>At the start the player chooses a class (Titan, Hunter or Warlock - corresponding with the classic Fighter, Rogue and Mage) and then customizes the appearance through race (Human, Awoken or Exo), gender, face, hair and marking. Each class has distinct abilities. The Titan is a fighter with an advanced mech suit, the Hunter is a bounty hunter with a knack for reconnaissance and ranged weapons, and the Warlock is a magical being that uses spells and explosives. Each class has various subclasses (unlocked at level 15) and specific abilities and statistics. None of the weapons in the game are restricted to a single class. The most distinct differences are the grenade types, jump abilities, melee attack and a special ability. The game borrows elements from the MMORPG genre in its design, with the Tower as a main hub zone to interact with NPCs, buy weapons, gear and Ghost upgrades, receive mail, buy and upgrade ships etc. Rewards for completing missions can also usually be collected here. The other major zones are Earth, the Moon, Mars and Venus, with some additional locations. While fighting, movement and jumps are important when confronting enemies. A Guardian can wield up to three main weapons (primary, special and heavy) next to grenades and other abilities. Only one weapon of each type can be equipped, but nine more for each type can be stored in an inventory to swap them.<br><br>Ships are used to travel through space to other planets. These voyages are not an interactive scene however as the game does not have a complete open world design. Each planet has its own story and various quests. Players complete missions by defeating enemies, collecting loot. Glimmer, the main currency is used to buy upgrades, vehicles, emblems ... The character also gains experience and levels up, accessing new abilities. From level 18 Vanguard Marks are unlocked as an additional currency for high-end gear, along with Vanguard Reputation as a reward for completing bounties. There are daily and weekly challenges to earn Marks, but the amount that can be earned has time constrictions. From level 20 the general experience system is replaced by Mote of Light. At that level the characters also gets to join one of three factions: Dead Orbit, New Monarchy or Future War Cult. The main story consists of different campaign missions that need to be completed for The Speaker, unlocked gradually and opened up on Earth, Moon, Venus and Mars respectively. Once unlocked however, they can be completed in any order. Next to the mission progression it is possible to enter a planet in exploration mode, offering free exploration. Each planet generally has five major story missions. These can be completed alone or in groups of six players working together.<br><br>Players can also optionally organize themselves in Fireteams for Strike missions, similar to MMORPG dungeons, that are harder with various mini-bosses and bosses. Fireteams are organized through online matchmaking and it is possible to make them public or private, and invite players. Only in Fireteams is voice chat possible. Outside of it communication is limited to gestures and prompts. Players also do not see all other online players at that location, only a selection. For the instance missions, the player''s character (and possibly other team members) are drawn in a private part in the game, cut off from the open game world. In these section characters can revive each other and there are checkpoints for respawns. Loot is personalized and does not need to be distributed between players. Each planet contains five major loot chests. Certain weapons and armour have a ranking system where they become better over time. There are also various types of engrams, a type of pattern for weapons or amour that can be turned into a special item with colour coding for the rarity level. Decoding them improves a separate ranking system with leveling to access additional engrams. When dead, other players can attempt to revive the player''s character with its Ghost nearby or eventually it respawns. Moving around on planets can be done on speeder bikes.<br><br>There are also Raids, much harder cooperative missions added gradually by the developer that do not support matchmaking and can only be taken on with players at a high level with high-end gear. Unlike Strike missions, no objectives or directions are given, players have to figure it out for themselves. Raids can be paused and resumed, unlike most of the rest of the game, but are reset after a weekly cycle. Competitive multiplayer is available in the The Crucible PvP game mode in a separate location. It offers game modes unlocked gradually including Clash, Control, Skirmish and Rumble. They come with different team sizes and include team deathmatch, capturing zones, team modes with vehicles and more. Level differences between players are nullified except for the skill tree unlocks, but the strength of the gear, weapons and equipped items makes a significant difference. The Crucible offers Crucible Marks as a currency along with Crucible Reputation.';

The most typical update is the actualized content for stadiums, teams (both national leagues and national teams), and players statistics. A first for the series, women''s teams are included with twelve national teams. Those matches can be played in different game modes: offline and online friendly games, and a tournament mode based on the FIFA Women''s World Cup. Mixed matches are not possible.<br><br>The main Career mode is updated with a new training mode. It is used to develop players and this is done through skill game, similar to how it was introduced in 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil. This is encouraged to raise a player''s transfer value. Prior to a new season it is possible to play a European tournament to earn additional starting money. The familiar Ultimate Team mode is also updated, focused on building a team through different decks of cards further supported through optional microtransactions for real money. There are some changes to the interface and the filtering systems for the transfer market. The versions for the different platforms are largely identical. A number of Legends (legendary players) for this game mode are exclusive to the Xbox versions, with players such as Deco, Litmanen and Giggs. FUT Draft is a new element for this mode, as a simplified version of the main game mode, but based on a selection of five players, and where Team Chemistry is equally important.<br><br>For the gameplay there are changes to the defensive mechanisms, most apparent through the better positioning of the defenders to keep the open spaces as small as possible. This can be countered on the offensive side with a ''pass with purpose'', a hard pass that can split the defense in many occasions, but is hard to control for strikers. There are new options for dribbling, for instance through faking a pose in a certain direction using the body to lure a defender in a certain direction.';

	des := '<i>Dishonored 2</i> is the sequel to Dishonored and it is set about fifteen years after the events of the first game. It had different endings and this game picks up the story for the one with the best outcome for the characters. Corvo Attano, once framed for the murder of empress Jessamine Kaldwin and the kidnapping of her daughter Emily, has his name cleared and is now Royal Protector of Emily, the new empress of the fictional Empire of the Isles. She has to deal with the Crown Killer, someone who is against her will killing all her enemies and opposition, making it look like she rules with an iron fist and undermining her power. At the same time early on in the story she is deposed by the Delilah Copperspoon, known especially from the first game''s story DLC, who claims the throne and says to be the older sister of Jessamine. She violently seizes power with the help of Luca Abele, Duke of Serkonos.<br><br>The change of regime is hostile and immediately the player has to choose between two protagonists, either Corvo or Emily, as the main character for the entire game. In the first game only Corvo was available and now there are two, each with their own supernatural abilities. Those can also be discarded entirely by rejecting the Outsider''s help and just like the first title it can also be approached as a pure action game with melee and ranged combat, as a pure stealth game or as a mix of everything. Unlike the first game there is no silent protagonist as they both are voiced and speak throughout the game. The game is no longer set in Dunwall except for a short part early on, but in the coastal city Karnaca in the southern part of the Empire of the Isles. Architecture, fashion and technology now draw from 19th century European countries like Greece, Italy and Spain. Where the first game linked together environments as hubs with loading times, Karnaca has a more of an open world-style approach as a single environment, but the game still uses hubs as large sandbox environments for missions. There is a main quest to pursue, but the character can also freely explore and discover many side quests or optional activities in a random order. Overall there are nine, large missions that usually each have a distinct environment such as the Addermire Institute, the Clockwork Mansion or the Royal Consevatory. Next to the overall design many of these locations have very different mechanics. A ship called the Dreadful Whale often transports the character between missions.<br><br>Just like Corvo, Emily has access to the Outsider''s Mark and can choose to use supernatural abilities or reject them entirely. Emily''s abilities often focus on distraction and they are Domino to link the fate and actions of two or more characters, Doppelganger to create a clone, Far Reach as a grappling hook, Mesmerize to turn enemies into a dream state and Shadow Walk to turn into smoke for stealth or to move through vents. Corvo''s familiar abilities are Bend Time, Blink, Dark Vision, Devouring Swarm and Possession. Abilities can be upgraded, for instance for Corvo''s Blink to pass through glass without breaking it or Emily''s Far Reach to snatch items harpoon-style. For stealth it is possible to knock out, drag and throw enemies, it is possible to distract using sound and alarms, and guards have an awareness meter based on sound, discoveries and alerting each other, and vision. The rat plague from the original game is replaced by blood flies. They can attack the character, but can also be turned into a distraction. When more enemies are killed, more flies appear.<br><br>Runes need to be discovered or bought at black markets to upgrade the abilities. The bone charm system of the original title returns, but in a new form. Players can now craft custom bone charms after unlocking that power, as equippable items that provide new powers. Bonecharms can add invisibility or invulnerability to specific actions or improve actions such as sprinting or swimming, or the regeneration of health or mana. Next to coins as the main currency, blueprints need to be located to upgrade the arsenal and there are paintings as optional collectibles. Based on the character''s aggressiveness and assassinations, a chaos level is determined which influences the outcome.';

	des := '<i>Gears of War 4</i> is the fourth main game in the series and aside from some early work it no longer involves the original developer Epic Games for the first time. It is set 25 years after the end of the Pendulum Wars between the Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG) and the Union of Independent Republics, the two superpowers of the planet Sera who fought for control over the natural resource "immulsion". Three of these battles are part of the interactive introduction mission of the game. The war was ended when COG gained the advantage, but it was immediately followed by a Locust attack on what is known as Emergence Day or E-Day. This ended in the destruction of all immulsion resources with the Imulsion Countermeasure weapon, which also took out the Locust and the Lambent. The aftermath has led to a society with a reformed COG with only hundreds of thousands of humans left, but void of fossil fuel and with powerful "windflare" storms that form across the planet Sera where the game takes place. To prevent the population from declining, cities are now walled off to prevent against outside danger. This has also led to the formation of Outsiders. These are survivors that reject the COG rule and live outside of the jurisdiction, conducting raids for resources.<br><br>The game''s story campaign focuses on J.D. Fenix, son of Marcus Fenix and Anya Stroud from the earlier games, together with his friends Delmont Walker and Kait Diaz. Early on they join an Outsiders group led by Reyna to get away from COG rule. They assist with raids and acquiring technology, until they are eventually attacked by unknown creatures dubbed The Swarm. This leads J.D. to reluctantly ask for the help of his father to identify and defeat the creatures. Next to Marcus, this brings back other known characters as well, such as Cole, Baird and Sam.<br><br>The gameplay relies on the familiar cover shooter mechanics. Dynamic covers now include boom shields, meat shields, and pods that can shot and sometimes contain an enemy. The game''s windflares play a role now, as grenades and other projectiles, but also character movement, is affected during storms. The main opponent is The Swarm, with character types such as Carriers, Drones, multiple types of Juvies, Pouncers, Snatchers (mostly a mini-boss) and more. They use similar weapons as they also rely on COG technology and employ similar tactics as the humans as well. Usually there is a party of three members and next to Fenix another character, usually Del or Kait, can be controlled by a second, human player. When playing alone all other characters are controlled by the AI. As usual only two weapons can be carried, with classic weapons such as the Lancer with its chainsaw. There are now two versions of the weapons, using the same ammo, as well as two types of sniper rifles, the Hammerburst, the Marzka MK1 and more. The Buzzkill is a new type of weapon that fires saw blades. Other new weapons are the Dropshot, EMBAR and Enforcer. A pistol and grenades can be used in addition, along with melee attacks and executions. It is now possible to slide over cover and vault kick enemies on the other side. Ammo is relatively scarce, so often weapons dropped by enemies need to be picked up.<br><br>Next to cooperative campaign for multiple players, the Horde multiplayer mode is featured for the third time, fighting 50 waves of enemies with up to five players working together. Some of this wave-based gameplay is also incorporated in segments of the regular campaign. New elements for the 3.0 version are skill and ability progression. Instead of the static locations near a command post in the previous game, players can now use a Fabricator to construct defenses, fortifications and weapons any where on the map. Characters can receive bonuses to statistics and abilities using Gear Cards. Unlocks and rewards are not based on level progression. Instead all action is rewarded with credits used to acquire Gear Packs with different types of content such as weapons and skins. Cards can be discarded for a different currency, Scrap, which in turn can be used to create almost any card in the game. Packs and other currency elements can also be bought straight away with real money.<br><br>Different modes are now part of Core and Competitive playlists. The latter have a higher difficulty level, putting more emphasis on team play by toning down damage or affecting aim assist. There is also a Social playlist where the Core modes are mixed and players can vote. Multiplayer modes include Arms Race, Dodgeball, Escalation, Execution, Guardian, King of the Hill, Team Deathmatch, and Warzone. Escalation and Execution are exclusive to the Competitive playlist. The game was launched with ten multiplayer maps. There is cross-platform multiplayer, but only for cooperative games, not competitive ones.';

	des := '<i>NBA 2K16</i> is the 17th main game in the annual NBA 2K series of basketball games. It is based on the 2015-2016 NBA season and features all of its competing teams as well as classic teams (including twelve new ones such as the 19992000 Toronto Raptors) and 25 European teams competing in the Euroleague. The basic gameplay works like in previous iterations but with some changes both in presentation and gameplay. This include upgraded player models and new animations, more realistic ball and rim physics and player collisions. Changes in controls include dedicated buttons for lobs and bounce passes. In addition to playing individual exhibition matches there are numerous other game modes such as MyCareer, MyGM, MyLeague and MyTeam.<br><br>The MyCareer mode is called Livin'' Da Dream and was developed in association with film maker Spike Lee. It is designed to be more story oriented and cinematic than previous games'' career modes and sees the player taking control of a young basketball player from Harlem called Frequency Vibrations ("Freq"). Freq starts out in a small high school team but as the story progresses he will move first to a college team and later the NBA. The ultimate goal is to become one of the greatest players of all time. Before starting out it is possible to customize the appearance of the player and to choose a position and scoring style. Games in the career modes only involve controlling one player with the others being AI driven. Between games the player has access to his own customizable court where he can upgrade his character or practice playing the game. It''s also possible to invite online friends to private games. In addition to playing the games the career mode also involves making choices off the court while interacting with other players, coaches, media and fans. <br><br>The MyGM mode allows the player to become the general manager of a team. This means the player has access to all aspects of the game including signing and trading players, negotiating contracts with both players and coaches, interacting with the team owner as well as media, building facilities and many other managerial tasks. New to this edition is the ability to move the team to a new city, summer leagues, three team trades and the ability to customize arenas and jerseys. The MyLeague mode is similar to MyGM but removes certain restrictions to make the game more flexible with more customization options. Whereas MyGM is an offline mode, MyLeague features various online components. The MyTeam mode involves building a team by collecting trading cards. By collecting cards players, playbooks and other items can be unlocked. Cards are bought with virtual currency and come in packs with a random selection of items. They have different levels indicating how good they are with bronze cards being cheaper, while gold cards are of higher quality. ';

Through a series of events Edward assumes the identity of a rogue member of the Assassins reporting to Laureano Torres, the Governor of Cuba and also the Grand Master of the Templars.

Unlike  FIFA 14, the PC version is now largely identical to the major console versions, using the new Ignite engine the first time for the platform, and the gap with the versions for previous generation consoles has become more extensive.<br><br>Except for some UI changes the offline career mode is largely identical. Searching for players still largely depends on scouting, but there are some new filters. The player search function of the previous version does not return. Tiredness and injuries still have a major impact, but now it is possible to design and save multiple squads and swap them quickly, without going through every change manually each time. It is still possible to become a coach and helpful items can be bought in the FIFA Store. Next to the known offline game modes, the option returns to design a custom tournament.<br><br>The Ultimate Team mode still focuses on collecting players and assembling a team with Ultimate Team Online Seasons as a sub mode. Players are bought as card sets. The transfer market has been reworked to view all available cards for a single player at once and the prices can be compared quickly. The ability to add players on loan to your team is also a first and some are also available through the EA Football World Catalogue. The ability to play together with someone else returns to the Seasons mode, but players who prefer not to go against a team controlled by two players can disable this in the matchmaking. Matchmaking now also immediately searches a new opponent after a game is over.<br><br>The major changes to the gameplay itself focus on tighter through balls. Technical players are able to show their dribbling skills and team mates have an improved run strategy to anticipate the passes. The ball has been made more loose in players'' handling, adding an element of randomness and more types of shots based on player ability, position and power. Theres also a larger chance of defenders deflecting the balls trajectory when in the line of a shot instead of just stopping it. The AI of keepers has been altered in accordance with the gameplay changes, adding in multiple calculation moments (when a ball changes trajectory for instance) and last minute saves.<br><br>A final change is added focus on atmosphere to make the presentation resemble TV broadcoasts more closely. This edition also adds pitch deformation where the actions of players leave can wear the pitch down with marks. An entirely new feature is Matchday Live where all real life news headlines about the chosen club are brought together on a single page.

The player does not only participate in this edition, but also has a hand in the organization now. Participating in races opens up new events and is rewarded with fans. When a new expansion becomes available the player can choose where to set up the hub. New events can then be created and the player determines which cars to allow, the time of day and conditions, which radio stations to sign up and so on. Races can be customized in design and name with the option to share creations with other players as event blueprints. This time a custom character can also be created as an avatar.<br><br>Many types of races from earlier <i>Forza Horizon</i> return as well as street races along with the usual championships, circuit races and exhibition races. Convoy races are a new type based on the feature to form convoys.

Showcase events return, with spectacular races using vehicles like sports cars, ATVs and trucks in different challenges. There are 350 cars in total and they are unlocked gradually and bought with credits. There are also Bucket List challenges to complete, based on a fixed difficulty level. As usual there is also open world racing without any restrictions. This can be done to visit the different locations, challenge other racers, earn experience through driving, locate hidden cars or destroy the many fast travel discount signs. Items of interest are revealed through a certain driving radius or they can all be unlocked by buying a treasure map. The Promo photo mode returns and there are now tasks to take and share photos. Next to credits as a basic currency, perks can be unlocked. Abilities can be upgraded in three categories, for elements as a festival organizer or as a racer.  A first for the <i>Horizon</i> series is the introduction of the main <i>Forza Motorsport</i> auction house where customized cars can be bought and sold. It also provides access to Horizon Edition cars with special XP and credit multiplier stat boosts that otherwise only can be won at a wheel spin when leveling up.<br><br>With the second Festival expansion online multiplayer is unlocked and it is cross-platform for up to twelve players. New for this version is the introduction of cooperative races for up to four players. Players join each other games to race together or help complete each other''s campaign tasks. It is played in the game of the host and even though there are some voting features, it is always the host who initiates races bringing the players into the race regardless of their position in the game world. Bucket List challenges can be completed this way too. With the fifth Festival expansion the clubs from <i>Horizon 2</i> are unlocked, as guilds providing credit bonuses and leaderboards. The game integrates support for Microsoft''s Groove Music music streaming subscription service as an option next to the regular music tracks.';

Like all games in the series, the focus is on its multiplayer mode in which player either take the role of an assault (front soldiers with medic abilities), recon (snipers), support (front soldiers who can give out ammo) or engineers (explosives experts). All classes have special abilities and gadgets which can be unlocked over time. In a variety of mostly team-based playing variants - most importantly conquest in which certain points on the maps have to be held by the own team and the faster rush mode with an defending team and an attacking team which has to destroy certain points - players face each other on usually big maps with a variety of vehicles to use. <br><br>Of course this instalments features various small and big differences to its predecessors. The most important are the interactive "Levolution" elements which emphasize the destroyable areas; one of the unique selling points of the Frostbite engine: each map has one level element which significantly changes how the level looks and plays when destroyed. <i>Battlefield 4</i> also brings back two elements from previous instalments: naval warfare and the commander mode. The commander is an additional player who sees the level from an overhead map, gives orders to the team members and can assign missile strikes. In contrast to Battlefield 2, the commander is not an actual player character on the battlefield and therefore can''t be killed. New playing modes are Defuse (both teams have to detonate a bomb in a target zone, each player has only one "life" per round) and Obliteration (there spawns only one bomb pack on the map which has to be used to detonate three points on the map).<br><br>Like the predecessor, <i>Battlefield 4</i> features a singleplayer campaign. A Chinese general overthrows the government, starts a war with the whole world (but is allied with Russia) and the USA has to save the day. The player takes the role of a faceless soldier named Recker, as commander of a small troop he can assign basic orders, who has to survive several missions of the usual Call of Duty variety: linear levels with a lot of boom and hundreds of enemies to shoot. In comparison to <i>Battlefield 3</i>, some levels are a bit more and in some cases the player drives a vehicle. Of course there are also the usual stealth and torture sequences. There is no co-op mode anymore.<br><br>The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions only allow 24 instead of 64 players at a time and have therefore smaller multiplayer maps.';

You design a custom player and after five warm-up games you start undrafted in the middle of the season or a team. He has to prove his worth through short contracts (for instance about ten days) to get a full NBA career. There are different teams to choose from each with their own requirements and standards. The game assists players new to the sport by showing overlaying diagrams on the court that tell you where to move and through a voiced coaching system. There are RPG elements to the progress and communication with the team is important through the mentor system. The subtitled conversations of the previous game have been replaced with recordings and these include the voices of real players of different teams. Off-field interactions provide a narrative to the career, including offers, agents and rivalries. There is an upgrading system to earn virtual currency through endorsements, performance badges and completing challenges.<br><br>MyPark, called The Park in the previous edition, is the online streetball mode. You choose one of three cities and then play mostly two-on-two or three-on-three games against rival parks. You wait next to a field to assemble players and it is possible to join a crew to earn points that benefit everyone in the crew, while you receive a crew bonus. The moves of a player can be upgraded through dunk packages purchased through VC, the virtual currency. Large packs of this currency can be bought for real money. This mode uses the same player from the MyCareer mode, but here the focus is more on upgrading moves rather than spending the currency on performance boosts required for MyCareer. Real money can be spent on creating a distinct player through buying clothes. A fourth park called The Stage set on a rooftop is exclusive to the PS4 version of the game. It has the highest stakes for players to bet virtual currency on their matches. The PS4 version also comes with a 10,000 virtual currency bonus and a MyTeam card pack exclusive to PlayStation Plus members.<br><br>The MyGM mode returns where you manage an entire team. Unlike the previous edition this mode has been uncoupled from a required online connection, unlike most of the other game modes in this release. It is possible to play all games, but the focus is mostly on attracting new players, tracking their progress, determining tickets prices etc. There is also more focus on the conversations you have with the players as this has a distinct impact on their performance. MySeason is the game mode where you design a custom season with preferred teams. It also offers some European teams. MyTeam is the game mode similar to the Ultimate Team mode of the FIFA series where you collect card packs to assemble custom teams. You bet the cards in matches and by doing well you earn points to buy additional packs. You can also have your team compete against those of other players.<br><br>During gameplay an optional timer appears as a semicircle below a player''s feet when he is about to take a shot, providing assistance to get the timing right to improve accuracy, based on the timing, the player''s statistics and fatigue, combined with distance and positioning relative to the defending team. The game contains many new animation, a redesigned defensive AI, and more control over blocks, steals and rebounding. New to this edition is scanning technology. Using the Kinect or PlayStation Eye peripheral you can have your face scanned to receive a realistic rendition in the game.';

	des := '<i>Far Cry 4</i> is the fourth main game in the open world action series. It has no narrative ties to Far Cry 3, but carries over many gameplay elements. The game is set in Kyrat, a fictional region based on the Himalayan regions of Nepal. It is governed by the depostic king Pagan Min. The player controls Ajay Ghale, an American with Kyrati roots who returns to the region to disperse his deceased mother''s ashes. As soon as he arrives he is dragged into the conflict and is rescued by the rebel organization The Golden Path started by his parents. During the game the Ajay can eventually choose which force to side with, with different endings. Inside The Golden Path there is a power struggle, and Ajay can choose between missions for Amita or Sabal, with different objectives based on the choices.<br><br>The mountainous region has both lush environments and snowy mountains. Vertical heights can be scaled using a grappling hook, and a glider or a zipline is used to move down. The player can follow the story missions or explore freely. Various vehicles are available to cross the distances and there is a fast travel option for important locations. There is an auto drive option where vehicles follow the roads to the next waypoint while the player can concentrate on shooting. Typical game elements that return are hunting animals (rhinos, pigs, bears, eagles, wolves, elephants ...) to craft upgrades, collecting plants for syringes, exploring locations for loot that can be sold at shops, trading points and sherpas, and a large amount of weapons including a bow, both melee weapons and long-ranged guns, grenades, mines, and explosives. It is possible to ride elephants as well. Next to the main quest there are various side quests and random karma events for separate karma points. Next to money and experience gained to level up, skills points are provided. These can be spent in The Tiger (aggressive) or The Elephant (defensive) skill tree. There are also a large amount of collectibles such as propaganda posters, masks, lost letters and pages of Mohan Ghale''s journal.<br><br>Bell towers can be climbed to remove the fog from sections of the map. There are 24 outposts to infiltrate and four large fortresses. It is possible to reset outposts to take them over using another tactic. Guns for hire tokens can be used to call in back-up for tough missions. Just like the previous game a stealth approach is always possible. Ajay can shoot open cages or throw bait to use wild animals to cause havoc. Stones can be thrown as a distraction. Both animals and enemies can be tagged with the camera to track movement. An indicator shows if Ajay has been discovered and guards have different alert states. Enemies can be taken out silently using a takedown, a throwing knife, weapons with a suppressor or the bow. The hunter is a new type of enemy that moves silently and can only be tagged for a short time. They quickly disappear, attempt to take you out and can charm animals to attack you. The game has a day and night cycle and Ajay can now sleep in a bed for a certain amount of time to skip the night for instance.<br><br>The single-player campaign can be played cooperatively (except for the main story missions). When playing alone and in a difficult situation, you can send a request for help for someone to join you, and vice versa. Online multiplayer is also supported through Battles of Kyrat, with different types of game modes such as Outpost, Demon Mask or Propaganda. Players who do not own the game can be invited to play along using a limited amount of keys. A level editor is included as well.';

In the single-player campaign the player controls Alex Taylor. He is a witness to the murder on his brother Datton, the leader of a crew called the 5-10''s, but is arrested himself. Five years later he is given the opportunity by the FBI to hunt down his brother''s killer Dennis ''Shiv'' Jefferson, the gang''s leader, as he is deployed to unmask the corrupt FBI agent Coburn who is also involved. He has to join the crew himself and make a name for himself to rise up the ranks.<br><br>The missions consist of a large amount of races and cut-scenes further the story, but there are also smaller challenges called ''skills'' such as slalom courses, staying on the ideal racing line, making big jumps to cross gaps and maintaining a certain speed for a set distance. Skills are triggered by driving through them. Next to regular checkpoints races against the clock or opponents there are specific tasks such as stealing a certain car, transporting packages, escaping from cops, performing takedowns or chauffeuring. As Taylor rises up the ranks and get tasks from the crew''s tiers V, V2, V4, V6 and eventually V8, new areas open up.

There are specs for each type of environment that enhance performance, such as Circuit, Dirt, Performance, Raid and Street, but not all cars have access to all of them. The game world uses a day-and-night cycle and a large map can be used to plan a route with navigation. Taylor gains experience to level up and the same applies to the cars. Regularly new car parts are supplied, often based on his performance, to upgrade the car. With each new level perks become available, used to give Taylor an experience boost or to further enhance the cars.<br><br>Next to the solo parts players can join crews to share the experience, work together and progress quicker. Crews of up to four people can form temporarily alliances with online players or with friends. Up to eight players are supported simultaneously in a single session. After the initial of the parts factions become available, such as the Eagles on the East Coast and the Wolves in the Midwest. Players get to join a certain faction to access PvP and PvE races. Joining a crew is the only way to earn crew credits, a secondary currency to buy perks and cars. The game supports microtransactions with real money to buy cars, but you cannot acquire any above your current level. This is never required to progress in the game. Crew credits can also be bought as large credits packs.<br><br>Each crew has a crew leader who can take a number of decisions, such as restarting a mission. There is also a large amount of social features to track scores and compare with friends. The game contains many types of cars from licensed manufacturers such as Aston Martin, Bentley, BMW and Ferrari. After the main game has been completed and level 50 is hit, platinum car parts can be obtained, as opposed to the gold ones, encouraging players to continue racing as these provide a random statistics boost to get the best possible car for PvP matches at the highest level.';

It starts when Scarecrow forces an evacuation of Gotham City by threatening to release a fear toxin. Many familiar characters and foes are present. The title refers to a new villain called Arkham Knight who backs Scarecrow. He wears a militaristic Batsuit and an Arkham symbol on his chest.<br><br>The game is set in an open world environment for Arkham City with main missions, side missions and the Riddler trophies that can be pursued freely. Familiar game elements return, such as the many melee combat sections, the use of gadgets and stealth abilities, and detective skills to examine clues in the environment and solve puzzles. Gadgets are used both during combat and while exploring. They include batarangs (now also used as a way to explore the environment), the batclaw, a disruptor, an electrical charge gun, explosive gel, freeze blast, grapnel gun, a line-launcher, a remote hacking device, smoke pellets, a voice synthesizer etc. Many of these return from previous games. Exploration is largely done using long flights with the cape.<br><br>An entirely new game element is the introduction of the batmobile as a playable vehicle for both exploration and combat. While on foot it can be summoned right away and Batman is able to eject to go into flight without interruption. The car is bulletproof, can smash through obstacles and is equipped with weapons. There are two modes to control the vehicle: Battle or Pursuit. Pursuit is used mostly for transportation and driving challenges. Battle provides tank-like controls for the car, with 360-degree range of movement, strafing and a large weapons arsenal. Next to the regular gameplay there are many sequences where the batmobile is used. The car can be controlled remotely and various upgrades such as an EMP gun can be equipped.<br><br>The combat retains the familiar combo and counter system. Enemy medics are new. They are able to shield certain enemies or revive unconscious ones. Fights are rewarded with experience points that are used to unlock new moves, health upgrades and new abilities for gadgets. Batman sometimes fights along allies (Catwoman, Nightwing, Robin) and the game introduces a Dual Play system where seamlessly switching during combat provides access to double takedowns.';

	des := '<i>Rise of the Tomb Raider</i> is the sequel to Tomb Raider (2014), which was a reboot of the long-running treasure hunter series starring Lara Croft. It takes place one year after the events of the previous game and has gameplay mechanics similar to that title. Her experiences with the supernatural in that game have been covered up by a violent sect known as Trinity. She is in the same predicament as her father before her, whose work was dismissed by the scientific community through pressure of Trinity. She travels to the Siberian tundra in search of the lost city Kitezh, to find tangible evidence of the immortal soul through a relic known as the Divine Source. The harsh and cold conditions turn most of the expedition''s crew away and only Lara and her companion Jonah push through. Jonah is by her side and part of the story for several sections, but most of the game is played once again with Lara alone. A small part early in the game is played as a flashback in Syria where Lara is looking for a prophet''s tomb while being hunted by Trinity, leading up to the events in Siberia.<br><br>While many game mechanics are similar, the largest difference is the change of scenery. It introduces new types of animals and now ice plays an important role in many sections. Just like the previous game the game world consists of many smaller open world areas linked together. Lara gets to explore these freely with multiple approaches. Many surfaces can be scaled using ice axes and ziplines can cover a large distance. Other means include a rope and grapple. There are also some linear sections, but almost no quick time events unlike the previous game. As before there is often a choice between direct combat and a stealth approach, but with more emphasis on combat as it is unavoidable or very time consuming to attempt otherwise in some occasions. Melee combat is available along with the use of a knife. Lara can tackle enemies and drop down on them from trees. Unlike the previous game health does not auto regenerate, but now always requires the use of bandages that need to be crafted. For stealth, enemies can be knocked out with non-lethal takedowns, through tackling or using knock out gas. It is also possible to use foliage to hide from both animals and humans. Swimming returns to the series after being absent since Tomb Raider: Underworld. In some sections Lara can hide by swimming below the ice and enemies can be hidden underwater with stealth takedowns.<br><br>As in the previous game there are many checkpoint locations known as base camps. There Lara can convert experience into skill points to invest into a skill tree, items in an inventory are accessed and crafted, weapons can be upgraded by salvaging items and fast travel to other base camps is possible. Next to pistols, shotguns, machine guns and hunting rifles, the bow and arrow is once again an important weapon. It is used to take out enemies stealthily, but rope arrows, fire arrows and explosive arrows are also used in many situations to solve environment based puzzles. Each area has multiple objectives and challenges to complete, along with discovering and collecting relics, documents, murals and coin caches. Some of these are now provided as side quests through NPCs. Taking a cue from metroidvania games, players are encouraged to revisit areas several times with new skills and weapons to reach or open up areas that were previously inaccessible. Many items are still crafted by collecting resources stored in an inventory, for instance to create a molotov cocktail. Environments have a day-and-night cycle that influences enemy and animal behaviour. For instance, some animals Lara has to hunt down are only active at night.<br><br>The skill tree is once again split up into the categories Survivor, Hunter and Brawler, with different tiers for each and seventeen skills in total. They provide new abilities for Lara as well as weapon enhancements and other skills. For instance she can now mark enemies and then quickly take them out in succession. Many new and powerful weapons are found by completely exploring an area with the full arsenal of skills to collect all the needed parts. As before the open world environments focus on exploration and combat, while most of the puzzle-solving is done in tombs. These separate locations often require logic and the use of different weapons, levers, objects and skills to complete the tomb and grab the rewards. These locations are optional and there are more of them that in the previous game.<br><br>An entirely new part of the game, accessed from the main menu, is Expeditions. These allow players to replay and modify levels to make them easier or more challenging, a concept previously used in a similar way in Hitman: Absolution, through various modifiers. Editing actions require Expedition Cards as a currency, bought with coins from the main game or with microtransactions based on real money. The game has four difficulty levels that influence enemy health and damage, and the use of aiming assistance.';

The plot is set about 20 years after the events of the previous game where the ending revealed that Shinnok used the void after Shao Kahn''s death to attack Earthrealm with his army of Netherrealm forces. Several characters work together to steal Shinnok''s amulet and imprison him inside, but eventually Mileena hatches a plan to release Shinnok by bringing the amulet to Quan Chi who escaped when Shinnok was imprisoned. The gap in years is mainly used to introduce the new characters to the cast, such as Cassie, the daughter of Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade (who married and divorced), Kotal Kahn as the new emperor of the Outworld, and Takeda, the son of Kenshi.<br><br>The game stays close to the visual style and the mechanics of the 2011 reboot. The main controls are still based on two types of punches and kicks, and blocking, to form combos with uppercuts, teleports, special moves that incorporate weapons and fatalities. The three-tiered energy from the previous title returns, making available X-Ray moves, powered up EX moves and combo breakers. As introduced in Injustice: Gods Among Us by the same developer characters can use the environment to re-position themselves or optionally use parts as weapons. Each character now has three variations with different moves and weapons. There is once again a sprinting gauge, returning from Mortal Kombat 4.<br><br>The trademark fatalities finishing moves are expanded with new types of finishers. Multiplayer games have quitalities where a character is immediately killed when a player leaves an online game prematurely and faction kills that are finishers tied to one of the game''s five factions. Brutality finishing moves return from Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, as powerful versions of moves that can be used at certain moments to link a combo into a finisher right away.<br><br>The recurring cast includes Ermac, Jax, Johnny Cage, Kano, Kenshi, Kitana, Kung Lao, Liu Kang, Mileena, Quan Chi, Raiden, Reptile, Scorpion, Shinnok, Sonya Blade and Sub-Zero. New playable characters are Cassie Cage, D''Vorah, Erron Black, Ferra/Torr, Jacqui Briggs, Kotal Kahn, Kung Jin and Takeda. There are 24 characters in total. Additional ones such as Goro, Jason Voorhees, Predator, Tanya and Tremor are either offered as DLC, appear as guest characters, or both. Baraka, Rain and Sindel appear in the story mode, but are not playable.<br><br>Next to the main Story mode there is King of the Hill, ranked matches, Survivor and Test Your Luck where fights have random round parameters. The Towers as challenges return, but now with play conditions that change constantly in the Living Towers. The online game has a persistent game mode called Faction Wars where players choose one of five factions (Black Dragon, the Brotherhood of Shadow, the Lin Kuei, Special Forces, and White Lotus) to fight in constant, cross-platform competitions to become the ruling faction. Competing in the Faction Wars is rewarded with a personal and faction-based leveling system, a currency, and the aforementioned faction kills. More outrageous types of fights such as one-versus-two or very difficult boss fights do not return from the previous game. Koins are the main currency in the game. They can be used to acquire secondary fatalities, brutalities, concept art, character skins and more. These are bought in the first-person dungeon crawling Krypt mode, returning from the previous game.';

	des := '<i>Forza Horizon 2</i> is the sequel to Forza Horizon, the arcade spin-off of the <i>Forza Motorsport</i> racing simulation games presented as an open world racing game. Transitioning to the next generation of Xbox, the two versions of the game largely share the same cars, assets, world and features, but were handled by different developers. Rather than upgrading or downgrading a version for the other platform, they each take a distinct direction based on the same concept and content.<br><br>Just like the original game the player participates in the Horizon Racing festival with light story elements. The first game''s environment was based on Colorado, USA, and now the sequel draws inspiration from southern France and northern Italy, combined with off-road racing and small villages. By participating in events and championships cash is earned and the character levels up, gaining access to new cars and events, with 210 cars in total. Just like the original game exploring is encouraged to locate hidden cars, and experience and travel banners. Different racers you encounter can be challenged freely and various actions are rewarded with experience (for instance through beating speed traps) or skill points for precision and dangerous actions, especially when linked together in succession. These skill points can be spent on perks. New to this game is the Wheel Spin system where a random sum of money or a car is provided after leveling up.<br><br>Cars can be customized through different parts, but also aesthetically through body kits, spoilers and a full livery editor. These customized car designs can be shared. The difficulty can be tweaked through general AI difficulty and assists such as traction control or the ideal racing line. Just like the original game there is an option to rewind a short part after a crash for instance. Online racing includes a road trip, free roam and private matches with various settings. Unique to multiplayer and returning from the original game are game modes such as infected and king. It is possible to join clubs and there are car meets where players can show off their cars to each other. In addition there are leaderboards to compete.<br><br>Graphically each version uses a different engine. The Xbox 360 version is based on the original <i>Forza Horizon</i>, while for the Xbox One Forza Motorsport 5 was used as a starting point. Differences are notable in draw distance, density of foliage, shadows, rendering and lighting. While both versions have a day-night cycle like the original game, Xbox One introduces more varied weather conditions with atmospheric effects. Any route is basically the same on both versions, but the Xbox One version has more traffic and more variation in the environmental design. Even though sharing the same game world, the location of events, circuits and side quests (such as bucket list quests where a new car is provided on loan) are unique to each version. The same applies to the showcase events, where you race against a land or air based vehicle, where some content is unique for each version. The Xbox 360 is also more limited in the online gameplay features. On Xbox One for instance it is possible to switch between offline and online racing seamlessly. There are differences in presentation as well, for instance in the ways cars are chosen. Entirely unique to the Xbox One version are Drivatars. These are opponents based on the racing behaviour of the developers and friends. They have different traits and introduce a human elements to the racing behaviour, with errors, collisions, or purposely veering off-road, populating the game world. These can be challenged in head-to-head events.';

Combat system has been slightly modified to allow smoother fighting against multiple opponents and usage of long-ranged weapons. Weapon and armor customization options have been noticeably increased.

	des := '<i>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</i> is an action role-playing game. It takes place between J.R.R. Tolkien''s <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. You play as Talion, a ranger of Gondor guarding Black Gate. Talion and his family are killed by Sauron''s armies led by Black Hand, but Talion is possessed by a mysterious wraith and is transferred to Mordor. His goal is avenging his family and revealing the identity of the wraith.<br><br><i>Shadow of Mordor</i> is an open world game, where you have freedom to explore Mordor and completing side quests. The game combines elements of the Assassin''s Creed series in terms of freely roaming the world and the Batman: Arkham series in terms of the combat system with complex combinations of offensive and defensive moves, and finishers.<br><br>The game uses a Nemesis system that remembers Talion''s interactions with enemies, adapting their behavior at a later time. For example, a defeated orc might want to take revenge on Talion, humiliating him in a similar manner and wear the scars of the previous fight. The Nemesis system also generates the bodyguards, captains and war chiefs of Sauron''s armies. They have their own hierarchy and become stronger as they manage to kill you, rising in the ranks. Captains who manage to beat Talion grow in strength and are promoted, and in time they become a serious challenge and a personal vendetta. Even though there are many fighting sequences, a large amount of stealth is encouraged to avoid overwhelming confrontations until many new weapons and abilities provide a wider range of tackling large groups. Captains can be killed permanently (usually by beheading them with a finisher), or you can choose to have them return at a later time through a regular kill. It is also possible to brand enemies which puts them under your influence. That way you can exercise control over them and have them fight by your side, but as it can be applied to all stages of the orc hierarchy it can also be used to influence the system from the inside. You can order a captain to kill his fellow captains and help determine their replacements.<br><br>The player can develop the abilities of Talion both as a ranger and as a wraith. Ranger abilities enhance stealth and make moving through the world unnoticed easier, while wraith abilities allow him to influence minds of enemies, allowing for example obtain information about captains and spreading unrest in enemy''s ranks. The information for instance reveals immunity or weak points of specific captains, providing an advantage for a next fight.<br><br>The later released Xbox 360 and PS3 versions have reduced graphics. The Nemesis AI system has also been reduced significantly is depth and variety. Content-wise, it is largely identical.<br><br>The pre-order retail release (US version only) of the game for PS4 includes a DLC voucher for downloading Blood Hunters Warband DLC and Flesh Burners Warband DLC. The voucher is valid from September 30, 2014 until December 31, 2024.';

	des := '<i>Assassin''s Creed: Syndicate</i> is the ninth major game in the <i>Assassin''s Creed</i> series and like previous titles it is a third-person action game with stealth set in a large open world environment. This game takes place in London in 1868 during the Industrial Revolution. Like many of the earlier games it is told as a simulation played in the present using the Animus technology from the Abstergo company from the viewpoint of an anonymous Assassin initiate. In the present Rebecca Crane and Shaun Hastings clash with the Templars who are searching for a Piece of Eden in modern day London. There are regularly short sequences in modern times, but the game is almost entirely played in the simulation of London following the Assassin twins Jacob and Evie Frye who look for Pieces of Eden. Their main target is also to thwart the Templar Grand Master Crawford Starrick who rules all of London by day and uses the Blighters street gang at night to get his dirty work done. Jacob and Evie need to bring him down by influencing and infiltrating the criminal underground, but also need to take over London with their Rooks gang fighting the Blighters, one area at a time.<br><br>After the initial sequences players can freely swap between Jacob and Evie at any moment in the open world, a first for the series, but they each have their separate main missions. Evie favours a stealth approach and is mostly after the Pieces of Eden, while Jacob is more confrontational in his actions and mainly wants to bring down Starrick. In the background many other Assassins are at work to stop the Templar control over the city. Most side missions are open to any character, but the main ones require a specific character to complete them. The characters have their separate storyline, but these often intersect. There are some separate missions that take place in a very different time as well, due to an Animus glitch that opens rifts in time. Many famous historical characters are a part of the story, such as Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, Florence Nightingale and Charles Dickens. There are also iconic buildings and environment such as Westminster Palace, the Big Ben, the Bank of England, the Tower of London and Buckingham Palace. The characters share money, experience and rewards, but have separate gear and skills. Like earlier titles a currency and experience is earned to buy and upgrade gear and weapons. Experience is converted into skill points that can be invested in three skill trees: combat, stealth and ecosystem.<br><br>As with previous game exploration and climbing is encouraged through a free running system. It is similar to the one in Assassin''s Creed: Unity with two options to pursue a path up or down. Entirely new to the series is the use of moving trains and driving through London using horse-drawn carriages, including one as a mobile headquarters. This is used to transport people or goods, or chase enemies, but it is also possible to kidnap enemies, put them in a carriage and demand a ransom. A rope launcher can be used to rappel up buildings quickly and it can also used as a zipline (returning from Assassin''s Creed: Revelations) to get down. There is a separate stealth system based on a ring and eagle eye vision. Fighting is done using close combat melee attacks with fists, brass knuckles and canes. There are also ranged weapons with many types of pistols. The system to punch, attack and block/counter is fairly similar to previous games. Enemies can now be beaten into a ''near death'' status where they remain defenseless. When this is done for several enemies, there is an opportunity for spectacular multi-kill finishing moves and executions. With a later skill, performing these can also scare other enemies away.<br><br>Next to the main missions there are various sidequests and activities to earn additional money such as carriage races and fight clubs. Many additional missions are based around territory control, taking over London sector by sector, similar to the gameplay of Assassin''s Creed: Brotherhood. This is done by completing activities and killing rival gang members. To completely secure a sector a large-scale gang war needs to be fought. The presence of Rooks in the area then becomes immediately visible and it is possible to invest in various gang upgrades to make them stronger. Unlike the previous titles back to <i>Brotherhood</i>, there is no multiplayer component to the game. Compared to the previous game the leveling system has been simplified, there are less currencies and there is no (required) integration of a companion app to unlock certain content. A few extras can be unlocked by logging into Ubisoft Club. Optionally the in-game currency can be bought with real money.';

The game is set in the large city of Harran, with influences of ancient Turkey, overrun by a mysterious epidemic. The protagonist is Kyle Crane, an undercover GRE operative sent inside a quarantine zone. His initial mission is to neutralize the rogue GRE operative Kadir Sulaiman, but he can also choose to focus on helping the survivors instead. He can freely explore the city using parkour and freerun mechanics. The game has a dynamic day and night system  during the day zombies are less aggressive, so players can gather supplies, weapons, craft items etc. and prepare for the night, when infested are stronger and more dangerous.<br><br>The focus is on melee weapons and just like in <i>Dead Island</i> various materials can be crafted into weapons by gathering supplies. Also borrowed from that game is the stamina bar that prevents the character from continuously hitting. Guns can also be used, but sound attracts others. By progressing through the game the character''s abilities can be leveled up in the skill trees agility, power, and survival. There are often large groups of zombies that can be taken out from heights, by pushing them off, using projectiles or triggering traps. Instead of stealth there is more focus on escaping using the parkour mechanics. Unlike games such as Assassin''s Creed it requires precise timing and aim to grab ledges and combine slides and jumps into fluid movement.<br><br>Progress through the city is furthered by unlocking safe zones where zombies cannot enter. During the day Crane mainly needs to scavenge, locate and save survivors, explore, set up traps and locate air drops. At night the slow zombies become much more agile. They do more damage, can sprint and will chase Crane. Especially the Volatile creatures are extremely fast and deadly, changing the game''s pace with more focus on stealth as enemies will easily catch up. The game becomes harder, but experience points are doubled at night. Aside from traps, sound and distractions, UV light can be used to slow them down. There is also a dynamic weather system.<br><br><i>Dying Light</i> offers an online co-op mode for up to four players. In the Be the Zombie mode there is asymmetrical multiplayer where one player-controlled powerful Night Hunter can invade another player''s game at night and up to four players can work together to defeat it.';

	des := '<i>DOOM</i> is a reboot of the first-person shooter series and it consists of three parts, accessed and loaded separately from the main menu: a single-player campaign, multiplayer with different game modes, and the SnapMap editor where custom maps and game modes can be created and shared. While many elements of the series are revisited, the focus for this entry is on fast gameplay based on movement, fights switching between different weapon combinations, and violent gameplay with brutal finishers, more akin to the first games. Compared to DOOM³ the areas are wider with more focus on verticality and rewarding an offensive approach, doing away with the slower horror aspect based on scares.<br><br>The single-player campaign consists of thirteen levels. It is set on Mars on a research facility of Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC). The facility has been able to solve an energy crisis on Earth by channeling energy from Hell into a renewable power source called Argent energy. The flow is controlled through the construction of an Argent Tower, both harnessing the energy and providing a portal directly to Hell. When the player''s character, referred to as the Doom Marine, wakes up in a sarcophagus-like prison, a full invasion from Hell is already in progress. The initial goal is to push back the invasion with the assistance of UAC research chief Samuel Hayden. Later on the focus shifts to stopping Olivia Pierce who heads a cult that wants to use the energy of the Argent Tower to bring all demonic armies through the portal. The game takes place in the research facility and in Hell.<br><br>Typical movement includes (double) jumping and crouching. Many objects can be climbed and by jumping it is possible to hang from ledges and climb up quickly. After acquiring the Praetor Suit early on, many types of upgrades are unlocked gradually by collecting tokens. Suit upgrade categories include environmental resistance, area-scanning technology (also affecting the 3D automap), equipment system, power-up effectiveness, and dexterity. Weapons such as the plasma gun, shotgun, heavy assault rifle, rocket launcher, lightning gun etc. can be upgraded with different points also earned during combat. In addition floating combat support drones can be used to modify weapons, often adding secondary firing modes. Next to the regular selection all weapons can be accessed directly through a weapon wheel while time is slowed down. There is another upgrade system where power surges, found in locations, are used to permanently upgrade the maximum amount of health, armour and ammo. In a codex entries on monsters, weapons, artifacts and environments are stored. Many monsters typical for the series return in an updated form.<br><br>Level usually consists of multiple objectives with markers that point in the right direction. Many levels are very wide with multiple approaches and the typical coloured keycards are used to lock off sections. Next to weapons, ammo and armor, levels contain secrets, optional challenges for rewards, collectibles, health stations and data logs. An entirely new feature for the series is the glory kill system. Killing enemies provides a small amount of health, but larger amounts can be acquired through glory kills. When enemies receive a certain amount of damage they stagger with a blue highlight. When close enough they turn orange and a dynamic glory kill finisher can be performed, different based on the angle. These glory kills can often be used to chain attacks together. Melee attacks are also possible as well as using explosive items in the environment. The chainsaw weapon has a specific use. It requires fuel and does a lot of damage, with fuel consumption based on the strength of the enemy. A chainsaw kill is rewarded with additional ammo for the regular weapons. Through optional rune trials in levels a large number of runes can be earned that can be equipped in a small amount of slots.<br><br>Multiplayer game modes include team deathmatch (kill enemy players in teams), soul harvest (defeated enemies leave behind souls that can be harvested), domination, warpath (control moving zones), freeze tag and clan arena. Multiplayer has a global experience system providing hack modules and aesthetic customization as rewards. These modules provide perks such as timers, boosts of the ability to see through walls. There are loadouts based on classes such as assault, sniper and ambusher. Custom loadouts can also be unlocked and defined. Some game modes allow characters to pick up a pentagram and temporarily become a demon who floats in the air, has a lot of health and deals a lot of damage.';

	des := '<i>Battlefield Hardline</i> is a first-person shooter and the first game in the series to focus on urban crime instead of military warfare. The game is done by a different developer and the single-player portion of the game is split up into ten episodes modeled after an episodic TV series format, including a preview of the next episode at the end and a recap of the previous one when starting a new episode.<br><br>The game is set in Miami, Los Angeles, the deserts in California and many other locations around the world. They often offer a sandbox-like approach with multiple, non-linear options to complete objectives. The protagonist is the young detective Nicholas Mendoza who follows a drug supply chain with his partner Khai Minh Dao. The game mixes classic first-person shooter mechanics with non-lethal actions to resemble a realistic police approach, including stealth and the ability to hold criminals at gunpoint and flash a badge to perform an arrest rather than shooting them. The latter is also rewarded with more points. When enemies operate in groups it is often possible to lure one away. As a detective Mendoza can also use a scanner to locate evidence. These lead to separate cases that can be solved and clues are often divided over multiple episodes. When a case is solved a short conclusion cut-scene is shown, some more of the background story is revealed, and a new weapon or item is provided as a reward. The weapons in the single-player part are generally lighter than usual for the series. The pistol is the primary weapon and more powerful ones are generally unlockable assault rifles rather than military-grade machine guns. Throwables such as grenades are also not used. A taser can be used to subdue suspects without killing them. These are presented as Open Warrants, optional objectives to arrest with specific characters who also often carry evidence.<br><br>The multiplayer arsenal is more similar to Battlefield 4 with grenades, rocket launchers and heavy machine guns. There is a global ranking system based on experience. This is shown through French playing cards with over 150 different rank insignia. Coins are earned by completing specific objectives and for a number of coins a bounty is provided. Service Stars are provided for progression towards specific objectives, divided over multiple tiers. There are bronze, silver and gold stars and they provide additional weapon attachments and vehicle modifications, unique weapon parts and cosmetic appearances for the different classes. Assignments from the previous games also return, rewarded with new items, attachments and patches for completing general assignments. Syndicate assignments, similar to Phantom assignments in <i>Battlefield 4</i>, are harder to complete and provide additional weapons.<br><br>The four main classes in multiplayer games are largely similar to those in the previous game, but modeled after police and criminal forces. Enforcers are hard hitters with additional gadgets, Mechanics are able to repair vehicles, sabotage bombs and use a satellite phone to generate spawn points, Operators are light fighters with medical gadgets, and Professionals focus on intelligence and stealth with range attacks as well as cameras, decoys and mines. Next to the classic Team Deathmatch and Conquest game modes that support up to 64 players, five new multiplayer modes are available with two sides: law enforcement and criminals.<br><br>In Blood Money both sides need to retrieve money from a location in the center of the map and return it to an armored truck. The first team to deposit $5 million or to have the most money when time runs out wins. It is possible to steal from each other''s truck. Crosshair is played 5-on-5 with a single life for each player and a session that lasts three minutes. The criminals need to kill a VIP while law enforcement needs to secure the VIP to an extraction point. Heists has the criminals break into vaults or armoured trucks to bring crash to an extraction point while the police attempts to stop them. Hotwire is similar to the flags in Conquest, but they are replaced by drivable cars. Just like in Conquest the game is won by capturing them, but the cars need to be driven at a certain speed to reduce the reinforcement tickets for the other side. Up to four players can board a single car and while one drives the other three can lean out of the windows to shoot. The game is won by removing all opposing tickets or by having the most when time runs out. Just like Crosshair, Rescue is played 5-on-5 with sessions that last three minutes and players only have a single life. Law enforcement is represented by S.W.A.T. officers that need to free hostages or kill the criminals. The criminals win by killing all officers.<br><br>Vehicles are generally faster than those in the previous games. They include regular cars, jeeps, vans, trucks, tankers, bikes and different types of helicopters (scout, transport, fighters ...). By using a zipline to traverse between buildings various alternative approaches can be used. Next to the standard equipment pick-ups and additional weapons can be found while playing.';

The controls are different for each platform. For Wii and Wii U movement is tracked through the Wii Remote, Xbox 360 and Xbox One require the Kinect peripheral, and PS3 and PS4 use the Move controllers along with the PlayStation Eye and PS Camera respectively. You can also download an app to an iOS or Android phone to use it as a controller. The app connects through the local Wi-Fi network and detects the console for the phones to register, based on the technology used in the game Just Dance Now. That way platform-specific peripherals are no longer required.<br><br>The tracklist varies slightly per region, some of the tracks are offered as DLC and there are a number of cover songs. Artists for this edition include Ariana Grande, Avicii, Calvin Harris, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, Nicki Minaj, One Direction, Pharrell Williams, Rihanna, Stromae etc. As with previous versions songs are divided into different game modes such as Dance Crew, Solo, Duet and new for this version Trio, carried over from Just Dance Kids 2014. For some of the songs alternative routines are offered, along with sweat routines, sweat mashups, non-stop shuffle (absent in the previous game) and extreme versions. Next to the main game modes Dance Mashup returns from Just Dance 3 with new versions of songs based on a specific theme. Just Dance VIP is a new game mode where celebrities record themselves dancing to a song and make it available to as a playable routine. Autodance returns for all platforms except the original Wii where the game records parts of the player''s performance and matches the music against it in a short clip that can be shared. The On-Stage mode of Just Dance 2014 with lead and backup dancers does not return.<br><br>Community Remix is an entirely new mode. Players can record themselves dancing a custom routine and share it with the community to vote. The development team then turns the highest rated ones into a playable routine for all players. Other people can be challenged used the Challenge mode to beat the score of other players as a ghost version, not as real-time multiplayer which is available in the World Dance Floor mode. The game''s social network is called Just Dance Wall. It is possible to sing along in the Karaoke mode. Returning is the Wii U and Xbox exclusive Party Master mode where one player acts as a game master to interfere with the routines of the dancers. For Wii U this is done using the GamePad and for Xbox it requires Smartglass.';

	des := '<i>Watch_Dogs 2</i> is the follow-up to Watch_Dogs with similar gameplay mechanics, but a different protagonist, a different setting and a lighter and more humorous tone for the themes and story. It is an open world game that can be explored on foot or by driving cars, trucks, buses, boats or bikes. Just like in the original game the protagonist, now Marcus Holloway, is a member of the Dedsec hackers collective. The game is now set in San Francisco, Oaklan, Marin and Silicon Valley with a size twice as large as Chicago in the previous game. Again the group goes against the control of ctOS (Central Operating System), now in 2.0 version, as a means to control all of the city as well as to spy on its citizens.<br><br>There are many famous landmarks in the game with special attention to the Silicon Valley and its many companies and employees which are often the centre of jokes. Many story sequences are presented as cut-scenes. At the start of the game Holloway is not a member of the collective yet. He is identified by ctOS as a potential threat and this leads him to breach the data centre and delete his ctOS profile, which impresses the Dedsec group. The fellow hackers he works with are Horatio, Josh, Sitara and Wrench. The goal is to take down ctOS and its company Blume. They also raise awareness as completing missions is rewarded with followers, people who take notice, as a means to further the narrative.<br><br>The different missions can often be completed in various ways. Enemies can be approached directly with gunplay, but most assignments encourage the use of stealth and a large amount of technological gadgets often accessed and controlled through Holloway''s in-game smartphone. Typical actions include hacking phones for voice and text messages, changing traffic lights, disabling security systems, taking over camera systems, controlling cars, turning junction boxes into proximity mines  and so on. The quadrocopter is entirely new as a drone that can be flown to scout locations as often terminals need to be reached with puzzle sections before a hack is successful. Another type of drone is a remote-controlled car can be driven to hack terminals from a remote location. Hacking is also often a means to attack enemies from a distance, for instance by activating cars and driving them into opponents. Marcus has some acrobatic, parkour-like moves to get around.<br><br>Additional options become available through an upgrade system. There are three categories which fit different playstyles: Agressor, Ghost and Trickster. Holloway is able to issue fake warrants so random citizens are arrested in police actions. He can also lure gangs into wars to make a location less densely populated. When he attracts too much attention himself the police attempts to hunt him down. Money earned during missions can be spent in various ways, for instance by creating weapons through 3D printing. Many side missions and additional information can often be found by snooping on anyone walking around. Cars can be stolen or they are delivered using an phone app. Large distances can also be crossed using a fast travel system. There are optional eKart races, also rewarded with money and followers. Sailing and participating in races is supported as well. Holloway can be customized through a large amount of clothing options.<br><br>The single-player game morphs seamlessly in a multiplayer environment when there is an online connection. That means that other online players can be encountered at any moment. Players can choose to cooperate and work together on missions or they can hack each other. In the latter called invasions someone installs viruses on another player''s system and needs to complete the process and escape. The targeted player can win by locating or killing the hacker in the vicinity before time runs out. Players can also work together to neutralize other players causing havoc in a Bounty Hunter session.';

	des := '<i>Titanfall 2</i> is the sequel to Titanfall. Just like the first game it is a fast shooter where battles are fought between agile Pilots using parkour-like movement on foot and mech-style Titans that are slower, but deal a lot of damage. Once again on many occasions players have the ability to call in, enter and exit these Titans during matches, quickly shifting between two very different types of gameplay. A lot of focus is on multiplayer matches, now supporting up to sixteen people in a single game, but entirely new is the inclusion of a full single-player campaign.<br><br>The campaign has a story with many levels that have different types of gameplay. At the same time it can be used as an introduction to the multiplayer mechanics. It includes  the Pilot movement and the available guns, controlling the six different types of Titans and experimenting with combined Pilot and Titan mechanics, both when controlling them and when confronting them as enemies. In the campaign the player controls the rookie Pilot Jack Cooper who dreams of controlling a Titan. He is part of a mission on the planet Typhon used as a battlefield between the two factions that were introduced in the first game. There is the Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation (IMC) and on the other side the Militia that Cooper is part of. The Militia mainly uses recycled parts and has been able to construct its own Titan, the Vanguard. Cooper allies with his former squadmate''s Titan BT-7274 to fight local creatures and the IMC. While the story is linear, many environments are open, allowing for different approaches focusing on movement, stealth and long-ranged or short-ranged weapons. There are multiple objectives and in many occasions the use of the acrobatic movement with wall jumping, wall running, platforms, a new sliding mechanic and double jumps leads to hidden areas or is used to solve environment based puzzles. Certain weapons and abilities are restricted to certain levels. There are also sections not outdoors, but inside military complexes. It is also possible to communicate and talk to the Titan. Other campaign elements introduced later on are portals and shifting between two types of realities on the fly.<br><br>Pilots carry up to two weapons along with grenades. There are six types of Titans that are all entirely new: Ion, Legion, Northstar, Ronin, Scorch, and Tone. They are divided over three classes: Atlas, Ogre and Stryder. They each have different abilities. Northstar is weaker, but can hover and launch a barrage of rockets, Legion is slow but well protected, Scorch uses a flamethrower, Tone has tracking rockets, Ronin aims to get close to do melee attacks with a katana etc. The battery is a new element. It is used to generate a shield, but as a separate component that needs to be attached manually. At the same time enemy soldiers can attempt to remove the battery to get rid of the shield right away or bring it to their own Titan.<br><br>The core multiplayer mode is still Attrition played between two teams of Pilots who can earn the points needed to call in Titans. Computer controlled Grunts are still present lending support and there is still the Epilogue segment where the defeated team attempts to escape, while the winners hunt them down to prevent the retreat. Capture the Flag returns along with Amped Hardpoint where three sectors need to be controlled. Coliseum is a new game mode. It is a duel played between two Pilots in a small dome as a simple shootout. The environments in that mode are flat so the focus is on shooting on running, even though the invisible dome walls can also be used to wall run. Bounty Hunt introduces fighting to earn a currency that can be exchanged at banks that appear on certain moments at fixed locations. It is based on risk and reward as all cash is lost when shot down, so players need to decide to exchange it right away or hold on to it until there is a safe moment when a bank reappears. As in the first game it is still possible to play matches only between Pilots or only between Titans.<br><br>Both Pilots and Titans have upgrade paths to unlock new abilities, items, weapons and customization options. There are now more rewards for a single player''s performance, rather than just taking the team effort into account. The Pilots now have access to a grappling hook to move around quickly. Other elements are cloak (returning from the first game), Tripwire of Ticks (bombs that hunt down characters), the Pulse Blade as a throwing knife that reveals the location of nearby enemies, a Holo Pilot as a decoy and the A-Wall fence-like shield. Loadouts can be defined before starting the game. Burn Cards are no longer a game element, but most of the advantages they offered, such as Map Hack to see through walls, are still part of the game. Soldiers use a smart pistol, shotguns, rifles etc. complemented with Tactical where the abilities and items are chosen.';

Unlike all previous games in the series no vehicles or modern weapons are available, only melee weapons such as clubs, axes and spears or short-ranged weapons such as bows. There are different types of ammo along with shards that can be used to poison enemies or make them go berserk. All of these need to be crafted by scavenging materials in the game world. Other game elements are learning to create and use fire (also to burn down parts of the environment), and hunting animals for food.<br><br>It is a time of great peril for the human race and the land is filled with dangerous predators such as sabretooth tigers and woolly mammoths. Animals still alive today such as tigers, leopards, wolves, bears and mountain lions are also present. The player controls Takkar, a member of the Wenja tribe, with the unique ability to tame wild animals. He must rebuild his village and unite the Wenja people against the flesh eating Udam tribe and the masters of fire of the Izila tribe. When the tribe becomes more popular, different types of upgrades for the village become available, tied to important tribe members such as the shaman, the hunter and the warrior. These upgrades then provide new quests, crafting options, and an expanded skill trees, one based on each character.<br><br>The game has a day-and-night cycle and the tamed animals can be used as companions in various ways, for instance to scout enemy camps, tag enemies, perform takedowns and drop bomb-like objects using the pet owl, riding animals and commanding them to attack.

	des := '<i>Thief</i> is a reboot of the <i>Thief</i> series and throws away most of the lore - there are no Pagans, no Hammers and no Watchers. The game starts when Garrett, a master thief, is on a job with his former apprentice Erin. They run into a mysterious ritual from a faction loosely reminiscent on the Mechanists, and due to unfortunate happenings Erin falls right into the middle of it. Garrett blacks out for a year and awakens in the city which changed to a fascist regime in the meantime. Now Garrett has to use his thieving skills in order to find out what is going on (the common people are affected by a strange disease) and eventually stop the usual conspiracy.<br><br>The basic structure is similar to Deadly Shadows: There is a semi-open city hub structured into various districts. Just like in the predecessor, those are divided in loading screens and gradually open up over the course of the game. These can be freely explored until starting a self-contained mission at the designated point. Here lies the main difference to the previous <i>Thief</i> games: instead of sandbox levels, the design is completely modular and can be compared to the Clocktower level in <i>Deadly Shadows</i>. The set-pieces may be relatively open in itself and offer various ways to deal with obstacles or reach the next point of interest, but in the end they result in a choke-point of no return leading to the next area. Movement is also restricted because jumping is only contextual. Rope arrows make their return, but can only be used at a few designated spots. Except for a few minor climbing sequences, the whole game is in first-person.<br><br>Garrett can take on guards in direct combat, the system is based on dodging attacks with a designated button and placing blackjack hits at the right moments, but since he is no fighter he usually has no change against multiple enemies. So his main weapon of choice is stealth. It is based on shadows - the light gem in the interface shows how visible Garrett is - and while breaking sight also plays its role, there is no dedicated cover mechanic like in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. However, Garrett can grab onto corners and peek out to avoid running in front of a guard. This means the majority of the time is spent with observing guard patrols, picking a good time to move behind a guard, performing a blackjack takedown and drag the body into darkness before someone sees it. Like in <i>Human Revolution</i>, the takedown is a context based button press instead of a free swing. <br><br>In contrast to the previous <i>Thief</i> games there is no loot requirement to beat a mission, but of course there is still plenty of stuff to steal which is directly converted into gold. While the majority of small loot items is just lying around or found by opening drawers, there are also unique items which bring extra money. These are usually hidden and require the usage of a new mechanic: Garrett grabs a painting or book shelf and slowly moves his hand until he feels a hidden switch. By pressing a button, it may open up a secret passage, unveil a safe or disable traps. The lockpicking minigame works similar and requires to find the sweet spot by moving the lockpick around. Safes require the combination which has to manually puzzled out by searching the environment for clues and carefully reading near documents.<br><br>Between missions, Garrett can also find much loot in the city by just moving around and keeping his eyes open. However, the most lucrative is to take optional side missions. Here Garrett has to retrieve a certain object - usually it is just a quick burglary within the city, but sometimes they are real self-contained missions. Of course there is a useful usage for money: visiting a shop and stock up on equipment. The obvious choices are depleting resources like Garrett''s trademark arrows which can be used for many tasks, e.g. regular arrows for distracting guards or water arrows to extinguish light sources, food items to heal, or smoke bombs. However, there are also various one-time purchases which reward new equipment to interact with the environment, e.g. a razor to cut out valuable painting or a wrench to open up ventilation shafts, or tool upgrades, e.g. a bigger arrow capacity or more sensitive lockpicks. Also available are items which reward passive bonuses. Additionally Garrett has two magical abilities to his disposal: The swoop move works similar to blink in Dishonored and allows to quickly move forward. Focus (similar to instinct in Hitman: Absolution) slows down time and has several useful perks, e.g. faster lockpicking, easier combat or showing all loot in the area. Those perks have to be unlocked with focus points which are also bought with money.<br><br>One of the game''s special features are the difficulty modes. While there are the usual three standard types - the highest does not allow for kills or civilian knockouts - the player can also add several other difficulty options, e.g. disabling focus, more expensive resources, slower movement, no kills or knockouts, no quicksave or permadeath. Because those reward bonus points for bragging rights, the difficulty can only be changed when starting a new game. On the other hand there are also several other interface related options which can be disabled at any time, e.g. loot glow, prompts when approaching an interactive item, enemy alert indicators, objective markers, mini map or ammo counter. <br><br>Besides the main campaign, there is also a challenge mode. This mode re-uses some of the game''s mission areas and adds special objectives. The modes are Chain  || CHR(38) || amp; Gain (there is a timer running out which can only be expanded by collecting loot), Chain  || CHR(38) || amp; Gain Limited (Chain  || CHR(38) || amp; Gain with an overall time limit) and Special Loot Hunt (finding as much special loot within a time limit by using the "hot and cold" indicators). The goal is a leaderboards high-score.<br><br>The PlayStation 4 version uses the DualShock 4 gamepad''s light bar to emphasize the effect of being in the shadow (with a dimmed dark blue) or exposed to the light (with a bright white).';

During that time new nightmares have appeared in the world and the Magician (who was defeated in <i>Rayman Origins</i>) has been split into five dark teensies. These nightmares and dark teensies have captured the princesses of the land (including a new playable character Barbara) and other teensies. Naturally, Rayman and his friends are awoken once again to right the wrongs. <br><br><i>Rayman Legends</i> retains the graphical style and most gameplay elements of <i>Rayman Origins</i>. Up to four players can simultaneously progress though side-scrolling levels defeating enemies and collecting Lums. In each level there is a number of teensies to rescue and that opens up new levels and worlds. All the powers from the previous game (wall-running, air gliding etc.) are available to the characters from the start, but some new gimmicks are added, for example the ability to fire projectiles in some levels.  Murfy the greenbottle appears in some levels to aid the players. With a press of a button he operates machinery, pokes bigger enemies and opens up passages for the characters. In some versions of the game the fifth player can control Murphy''s movement. <br><br>The game includes regular side-scrolling levels, "invaded" versions of levels that need to be completed as quickly as possible, and rhythm-based levels with soundtrack consisting of humorous covers of popular songs. In addition, forty remastered levels from <i>Rayman Origins</i> can be unlocked by collecting Lucky tickets. The game offers daily and weekly challenges and a local multiplayer soccer mini-game titled Kung Foot. ';

Instead, all of the content is available right away and players can race in any mode, class, car and on any circuit immediately. Similar to games like iRacing and Assetto Corsa it offers very detailed customization where players can fine-tune almost any aspect of the cars, but contrary to those two titles there is not only multiplayer racing, but also a full career mode with offline races against AI-controlled opponents. Optionally various assists can be enabled to simply the gameplay.<br><br>The game offers circa 70 cars in various types of motorsports such as classic retro tour cars, traditional road cars, karts, track day cars, supercars, modern open wheel cars, GT cars and Le Mans prototypes. Brands include Aston Martin, Audi, BMW, Ford, Lotus, McLaren, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Renault and more. Brands such as Ferrari and Lamborghini are not included. Certain cars are part of a modified car pack, some are tied to a specific edition and others are given away for free each month. The game includes a large amount of racing circuits from around the world as well as a number of fictional ones and also point-to-point races.<br><br>The career mode offers several goals to climb the ranks, win championships and earn contracts to race in higher series. Examples of challenges include <i>Defending Champ</i> to win three seasons in a row undefeated, <i>Triple Crown</i> to win three different types of championships and <i>Zero to Hero</i> where you go through championships for the different race classes, from karts to Formula 1. There are several championships presented as race weekends split up in practice rounds, qualifiers and race sessions that often consist of multiple races. Optionally certain sessions can be skipped or simulated. It is possible to design custom races, there are various weather conditions and the developers organize events regularly. Online multiplayer is not done through matchmaking but through playlists curated by the developer. Next to regular races it is possible to challenge other players to time trials. The Driver Network keeps track of the player''s progress, stats and results for the various cars and parts of the game. <br><br><i>CARS</i> from the title is an acronym for <i>Community Assisted Racing Simulator</i>, which reflects the game''s development. The game was crowd funded where contributors could involve themselves in the development through Tool Packs which allowed for the creation of assets, content, QA and other parts of the development process with various rewards.';

The world is heavily divided between those with augmentations and those who do not, with the latter fearing the former following the ending of the previous game. This division is known as the "mechanical apartheid".<br><br>As with the previous game, players will investigate the bombing by speaking to characters, exploring the environment, and completing missions however they choose. Various actions, such as completing quests, finding alternate routes, hacking terminals, and neutralizing enemies earn the player Praxis points, which they can use to activate Jensen''s mechanical augmentations. These augmentations give Jensen abilities such as turning invisible, strength to lift heavy objects, and hacking into higher-level terminals. In addition to most of the augmentations from Human Revolution, several new "experimental" augmentations are available. Due to their untested and unauthorized nature, the player must deactivate one of Jensen''s original augmentations in order to use one of these.<br><br>The game utilizes the same hybrid first/third-person combat system seen in <i>Human Revolution</i>, with the camera moving to third-person whenever Jensen is pressed against cover.

Some of the new augmentations offer additional weapons, including a blade projectile and an electric weapon which knocks out several enemies at once. Guns can be customized on the fly using crafting materials gathered by exploring the game world. Crafting parts can also be used to make special items such as mine templates and multitools, which can hack into any terminal.<br><br>In addition to the main campaign, there is another mode called "Breach".
