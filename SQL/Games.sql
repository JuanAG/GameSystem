A war is brewing in this territory between the NCR (New California Republic) and various tribes of raiders, including the Great Khans and Caesar''s Legionnaires.

However, once the package finds its way to its destination, a man in a checkered shirt and a pair of thugs intercept the courier and begin to dig an open grave.

There is a larger variety of weaponry, and the player can now aim down the sights with guns, as well as change the type of ammo the gun uses.  Different types of ammo have different effects on enemies.  The player can also use workbenches, campfires, and reload benches to craft unique items, consumables, and ammunition respectively. There is an influence system in the protagonist''s standing with various towns and factions.  The influence rating will determine whether or not that faction or town is friendly to the protagonist or not, and his affiliation to some groups may affect this as well. The player can also try and fool enemy factions by dressing up as a member of that faction, but must use stealth to avoid guards as guards may see past the disguise.<br><br>There is also a new mode of play known as &quot;Hardcore&quot; mode.

Only a doctor bag can heal a crippled limb.</li><li>Similarly, the RadAway chem does not remove radiation sickness immediately, but rather over a period of time.<li>The protagonist must eat food, drink water, and sleep on a regular basis, or he/she will die.<li>Ammo adds weight and encumbers the protagonist.<li>Companions can be killed in battle.</ul>As in <i>Fallout 3</i>, the protagonist levels up, gains perks (although perks now come every other level and instead of starting with a perk, the player starts with two special traits),  and can use functions such as fast traveling, waiting or sleeping to adjust the time of day, and fight foes in action combat using the traditional first-person control scheme (although the third-person camera is still an option), or the V.A.T.S. targeting system, which allows the player to pause the game and target specific parts of the enemy''s body.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows 7/Vista/XP<br/>Processor: Intel/AMD Dual Core CPU with 2 GHz or better<br/>RAM: 2 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 10 GB<br/>Video: NVIDIA GeForce 6 series, ATI 1300XT series or better<br/>Sound: DirectX compatible Sound Card', 18, 'front.jpg#back.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#6.jpg#7.jpg#8.jpg#9.jpg#10.jpg#11.jpg#12.jpg#13.jpg#14.jpg#15.jpg#16.jpg#17.jpg#18.jpg#19.jpg#20.jpg#21.jpg#22.jpg#23.jpg#24.jpg#25.jpg#26.jpg#27.jpg#28.jpg#29.jpg#30.jpg#31.jpg#32.jpg#33.jpg#34.jpg#35.jpg#36.jpg#37.jpg#38.jpg#39.jpg#40.jpg#41.jpg#42.jpg#43.jpg#44.jpg#45.jpg#46.jpg#47.jpg#48.jpg#49.jpg#50.jpg#51.jpg#52.jpg#53.jpg#54.jpg#55.jpg#56.jpg#57.jpg#58.jpg#59.jpg#60.jpg#61.jpg#YOUTUBE#l-x-1fm2cq8', 'N');

The Queen of Blades, formerly known as Sarah Kerrigan, is still out there and Arcturus Mengsk''s administration turns out to be even more dangerous than the Confederacy. No wonder that four years after the events of StarCraft: Brood War, Jim Raynor is trying to drown his sorrows with booze, while helping the rebels on Mar Sara in the fight against Mengsk''s Dominion.The trot changes, however, when one day Tychus Findley, imprisoned for life by the Dominion, shows up proposing a deal. Soon after that, Backwater Station is overrun by the Zerg, who are now the dominant species in the Koprulu Sector, revealing an invasion of the Terran systems. So, Raynor retreats to his flagship, the battlecruiser Hyperion, and once again enters the fight for survival - and the search for his beloved Kerrigan.<br><br><i>StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty</i> is the first part in the <i>StarCraft II</i> trilogy. As such, most of the 29 missions of the single-player campaign have the player fight on the Terran side. There are, however, a few missions where the Protoss Zeratul gets to tell parts of his side of the story, with the player controlling him and his Protoss friends. Most of the missions feature different and changing objectives but are, at their core, all about real-time strategy, with the player more often than not having to build up his base from scratch, collect the two resources, produce and upgrade an army and fight the usual suspects: other Terrans, Zerg and Protoss. The gameplay is pretty straightforward RTS, using a rock-paper-scissors system in combat between the three very different races, with each unit vulnerable to several other units and vice versa.<br><br>As the campaign progresses, the player automatically gains access to new units, which he can then upgrade in the Armory of the Hyperion in exchange for money, also earned throughout the missions. Each unit and some of the buildings can be upgraded two times, unlocking new abilities for the unit. The stimpack for the Marines, for example, which allows them to do more damage for a short amount of time at the expense of some health.In addition, there''s the Laboratory on the Hyperion. Here, the scientists research Zerg and Protoss DNA, which the player collects during missions by fulfilling bonus objectives. These range from simply gathering samples from dead Zerg to killing a hulking Brutalisk. After each five tiers of the DNA double helix, the player can choose between two possible upgrades in each research tree, allowing him, for example, to either automate the collection of Vespine Gas or build two SCVs at once.

Here, the player chooses one from up to three missions as his next assignment, has the ability to replay both the in-game cutscenes and the rendered sequences and replay old missions, e.g. on a higher difficulty level to earn additional achievements or to discover the consequences of different choices as the branching plot unfolds.<br><br>The fourth deck is the Cantina. Here, the player can look at trophies earned for completing a story strand (e.g. all missions given by Tychus), watch the news, hire mercenaries (who will then become available in all upcoming missions in exchange for resources) or play a round of &quot;The Lost Viking&quot;.

Nine challenges are available to test the abilities of the player to e.g. know which units are best against others or how to survive the infamous Zerg rush.In addition, after entering the multiplayer, the player has to play several practice rounds during which the game judges his skill and throws him in one of the five leagues (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum and Diamond) and activates the match-making feature. Here, or in custom games, he can fight against up to eight players on 61 maps, some of which are specially made beginner''s versions of other maps to prevent early rushes.

The Draenei are from Outland and having heard of the defeat of the Burning Legion by the forces on Azeroth, they have taken their ship, the Exodar, to Azeroth in search of help defeating the Legion in Outland.  However, the Blood Elves sabotaged their ship and they crashed onto Azeroth and must pick up the pieces and go out in search of more allies.  The Blood Elves, on the other hand, have come to do anything they can to stop the the Draenei and have little trust for either the Horde or Alliance.

The Emperor''s throne remained without heir; the Blades, Empire''s elite guards, have been disassembled; elven nations began capturing territory from the Empire. The assassination of the King of Skyrim, Tamriel''s Northern-most province and home of the Nord race, led to a civil war between those who wish independence for Skyrim and those who wanted it to remain under the Empire''s control. <br><br>A prisoner is brought to a small town, awaiting execution for alleged involvement with the Stormcloaks, a group that was founded by the king''s assassin Ulfric Stormcloak. Just before the executioner''s axe lands on the prisoner''s neck, a dragon attacks the city, forcing most people to flee. The unexpected freedom leads the ex-prisoner into the snowy Skyrim, where the rumors of the dragon begin to circulate.<br><br>Like its predecessors in the <i>Elder Scrolls</i> series, <i>Skyrim</i> is an open-ended role-playing game with action-based combat. The player may explore the vast environments of Skyrim from either first- (default) or third-person perspective, being unrestricted in his or her travels and free to undertake any side quests in any order, or follow the main quest. It is possible to fast-travel to previously visited locations directly from the world map. The player can also opt to buy (or steal) and ride a horse.<br><br>There are ten races to choose from:  Altmer (High Elves), Argonian (reptile people), Bosmer (Wood Elves), Breton, Dunmer (Dark Elves), Imperial, Khajiit (cat people), Nord, Orc, and Redguard.  Each race has their own perks and limitations, such as Nord being resistant to cold, Khajiit being weak with magic, etc. Unlike the previous games in the series, the player cannot choose a class for the main character; rather, the latter evolves into any class-like combination gradually, according to the play style. When the protagonist reaches a new level, the player may increase his or her Health, Magicka, or Stamina and a new perk may be added to one of the skills. There are eighteen skills altogether, and each skill has several levels and perks which may be obtained.  Most perks are only accessible after a certain level has been reached in said perk.  For instance, in order to reach higher perks with Destruction, destructive spells must be leveled up.  Skill levels can increase either through extensive use, skill books, or even paying for training from certain non-playable characters.  <br><br>The game contains some features that were introduced in Fallout 3. Enemy level-scaling is done in a similar way, as opposed to the more intrusive system of <i>Oblivion</i>. The player may hire other fighters to follow the hero around and lend a helping hand in combat.  Also, the lockpicking system of the previous installment has been replaced by the lockpicking methods of the recent <i>Fallout</i> games. Conversations with NPCs now occur in real time rather than &quot;freezing&quot; time as in <i>Oblivion</i>. <br><br>Players can craft, cook, or build any number of items depending on ingredients and skill levels.  Alchemy allows players to make potions, Enchanting allows players to imbue armor and items with magical abilities (such as increasing the effectiveness of magic resistance), and Smithing allows players to either craft or improve weapons and armor.  Smelting, tanning and cooking are also a part of this mix as well:  Smelting is the skill of turning raw mined mineral ores into usable ingots for smithing; Tanning is the process of drying animal hides to make leather strips, useful in creating or improving armor and weapons; Cooking allows players to turn otherwise minimally useful food ingredients into much more beneficial meals.  <br><br>Melee attacks can be performed using either two or one-handed weapons. Blocking reduces damage and allows for the opportunity to bash an opponent with a shield. Archery is also available for some ranged attacks, as is quite a bit of magicka. Each race also has a distinct magic-like power ability; only one power may be equipped at a time. For instance, a Nord power is to frighten enemies away for a while. New to the series is the Shout ability, which is a special power based on Dragon language. These require a special set of circumstances to unlock: first, the ancient words must be learned from Word Walls hidden all over Skyrim; secondly, they can only be activated by acquiring a dragon soul (from slaying a dragon).  <br><br>Crimes may be committed by stealing, pickpocketing, murder or attacking innocent people, or even by trespassing.  Generally this puts a bounty on the head of the player character, unless said character is quick enough to eliminate all witnesses.  Fines and jail time, or a beat-down from authorities, are likely to ensue if the hero commits too many crimes or merely ends up getting caught.  The protagonist can serve out his or her sentence on the jail bed, or pick the lock and escape; however, going to jail is likely to cause current skill progress to be lost.  <br><br>As before, there are several groups, guilds, and the like that the player may encounter and join, each with their own advantages or disadvantages, each with their own views on the current events of the world, and each with their own quests. The abilities to become a werewolf or vampire are also present and have been somewhat streamlined: for instance, sunlight is not instantly deadly to vampires, and lycanthropy can be spread around.  #REQUISITOS#OS: Windows 7/Vista/XP<br/>Processor: 2GHz Dual Core CPU or equivalent<br/>RAM: 2 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 7 GB<br/>Video: DirectX 9.0c compatible Graphics Card with 512 MB VRAM<br/>Sound: DirectX compatible Sound Card', 18, 'front.jpg#back.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#6.jpg#7.jpg#8.jpg#9.jpg#10.jpg#11.jpg#12.jpg#13.jpg#14.jpg#15.jpg#16.jpg#17.jpg#18.jpg#19.jpg#20.jpg#21.jpg#22.jpg#23.jpg#24.jpg#25.jpg#26.jpg#27.jpg#28.jpg#29.jpg#30.jpg#31.jpg#32.jpg#33.jpg#34.jpg#35.jpg#36.jpg#37.jpg#38.jpg#39.jpg#40.jpg#41.jpg#42.jpg#43.jpg#44.jpg#45.jpg#46.jpg#47.jpg#48.jpg#49.jpg#50.jpg#YOUTUBE#JSRtYpNRoN0', 'N');

Even though the tropical setting resembles the original Far Cry, the gameplay itself is closer to Far Cry 2 as the open world exploration is supplemented by role-playing elements with experience points, crafting, trading, hunting and three skills trees.<br><br>The protagonist is Jason Brody, a daredevil who is on a holiday in the Pacific with his two brothers and some friends. When they take a skydiving trip, they land on an island that is controlled by pirates. They are all taken prisoner by the pirate warlord Vaas and his older brother Grant is killed when they attempt to escape. Vaas sarcastically gives Jason an opportunity of 30 seconds to escape before he hunts him down. Against all odds, Jason succeeds by jumping into the water. He is rescued by Dennis Rogers who introduces him to the Rakyat, the native tribe that hopes to rid the island off the pirates. During the search for the remaining survivors Jason will be initiated into the mysticism of the tribe, discover the environment and hunt down Vaas. After the introduction the player is however largely free to leave the main quest along and discover the islands at his own pace and leisure, as all of the playable area is available right away.<br><br>The rook archipelago is a dangerous environment filled with pirate settlements and local animals such as tigers, bears, sharks, komodo dragons, boars, goat, snakes, rabid dogs etc. It is split up into different sections that are revealed gradually as soon as a radio tower in the sector has been taken over. These reveal the entire environment and open up quests, but areas can also be traversed without a detailed map. There are various safe houses to travel around and exchange loot at all-purpose vending machines. Players can kill pirates, complete quests, but also collect plants and hunt down animals for their skin. Money is exchanged for weapons, modifications and items such as syringes, but crafting also plays an important role. By discovering recipes, plants can be turned into fluids that are injected to enhance abilities. In addition animals skins are used to craft items that extend Jason''s weapon belt up to four slots, provide a larger wallet to store money, increase his ammo belt and a lot more. Completing quests and killing pirates is rewarded with skill points that are used on one of the three available skill trees. These determine the playing style, as Heron deals with mobility and long-range attacks, Spider with stealth and survival, and Shark with assault and healing. For each new skill acquired, Jason receives a tattoo on his arm.<br><br>Even though it is a shooter with machine guns, assault rifles, hand guns, bows, flamethrowers, mines, RPGs and grenades, almost all of the game can be played with a stealth approach. Jason can crouch and hide in the foliage to remain hidden. A meter shows how visible he is to opponents. By sneaking up on them stealth takedowns with a knife can be performed and bodies can be dragged away. He can also throw rocks or use sounds to isolate pirates. His camera is used to zoom in and mark opponents. Once they are marked they remain visible through an outline even when there are walls or objects in the way, helping to track movement. The same can be done with animals. Moving around is done by foot, but there are also different vehicles such as cars, jeeps, quads, boats, jet skis and paragliders along with zip lines and swimming to move more quickly.<br><br>If Jason chooses to help the natives, he can infiltrate and take over more than 30 outposts. Once these settlements are cleared, they become property of the natives and a safe house for fast travel and shopping is offered. Every animal and character has dynamic behavior, acting regardless of Jason''s actions. That way he can observe animals attacking each other or use it to his advantage to clear a group of enemies, and villagers will move out and conquer more territory independently once Jason clears an outpost. Enemies patrol around the island on foot or in cars with non-scripted behavior. Once Jason is discovered, they will often call in reinforcements from another location and chase him down. Additional ammo and weapons can be picked up from fallen enemies, and money and items are also collected that way, along with many hidden loot chests and additional collectibles such as letters from fallen soldiers during World War II and relics. Weapons that are bought can be re-acquired at any time without an additional cost from the vending machine even when they were lost or exchanged during a quests. Weapons can further be customized through various modifications such as scopes, laser pointers, silencers and more room for ammo.<br><br>Multiplayer consists of a separate cooperative campaign for up to four players that takes place six months before the events of the main game. It is set on a separate island of the Rook archipelago and features four characters: a thug called Callum, the crooked cop Leonard, the Russian hitman Mikhail and ex-soldier Tisha. They were redeeming their past actions by working on a cruise ship when they are scammed out of their money by the pirates. By pursuing them, they end up on the island. The campaign is split up into six missions that take about an hour each, interspersed with cut-scenes. The missions typically have the characters working together to travel to a location, killing all enemies and then completing objectives such as protecting equipment, finding a specific type of ammo or guarding another player. Experience is also gained here and there are multiplayer unlockables and custom loadouts. Competitive elements between players are also encouraged, such as getting the most sniping kills for instance, with an additional experience bonus. Two additional elements are battle cry and booster systems. Battle cries are temporary buffs that affect team mates in the vicinity and boosters are stronger buffs provided through syringes.<br><br>The competitive multiplayer modes include team deathmatch, domination, transmission and firestorm. Transmission and firestorm are similar to domination. Transmission is about radio transmitters as control points but they sometimes change locations. Firestorm has each team set fire simultaneously to two fuel dumps held by the other team, while defending their own. Once a successful fire has been achieved, almost the entire environment becomes ablaze and the teams then need to fight over a radio control point. Additional multiplayer bonuses and perks are gathered by unlocking encrypted data with a time limit. In these modes players can also level up through a permanent system and use battles cries, booster systems, revive team mates or call in support. After matches there are interactive cut-scenes where players can choose to show mercy or punish (kill) opponents.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows 7<br/>Processor: 2.66 GHz IntelÂ® Coreâ¢2 Duo E6700 or 3.00 GHz AMD Athlonâ¢ 64 X2 6000+ or better<br/>RAM: 4 GB<br/>Hard Drive: N/A<br/>Video: 512 MB DirectX 9.0c-compliant card with Shader Model 3.0 or higher<br/>Sound: Yes', 18, 'front.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#6.jpg#7.jpg#8.jpg#9.jpg#10.jpg#11.jpg#12.jpg#13.jpg#14.jpg#15.jpg#16.jpg#17.jpg#18.jpg#19.jpg#20.jpg#21.jpg#22.jpg#23.jpg#24.jpg#25.jpg#26.jpg#27.jpg#28.jpg#29.jpg#30.jpg#31.jpg#32.jpg#33.jpg#34.jpg#35.jpg#36.jpg#37.jpg#38.jpg#39.jpg#40.jpg#41.jpg#42.jpg#43.jpg#44.jpg#45.jpg#46.jpg#47.jpg#48.jpg#YOUTUBE#RsrYZpswwtM', 'N');

However, many years of controversy and waning influence came to a head when the UN launched an investigation into alleged human rights violations, which was shortly thereafter followed by an explosion that claimed Overwatch HQ and the lives of two of its most prominent members.

The game is set in the near future when Earth is invaded by aliens. The player is put at the head of the elite multinational military organization XCOM (Extraterrestrial Combat Unit) tasked to defend Earth against the invaders as regularly military actions remain without result. This is done through a series of missions where the player commands a small troop. Between missions the larger management aspect is tackled through research and development to create new technologies and weapons using captured aliens and technology recovered from the missions. That way, the underground HQ is expanded to have a larger reach with new structures and the player is also responsible for the management of finances and monitoring alien activity. Players also need to keep panic under control. If a certain region of country is left unattended for too long, the local government will cut back its contributions to the XCOM funding, slowing down the overall progress. There are also often cut-scenes that further an overall story.<br><br>For missions a squad of four to six soldiers is selected from a pool of about twenty. Missions are set in small areas usually centered around a specific building. Missions are shown from a 3D isometric-style, floating view and a fog of war shrouds most of the environment until the soldiers uncover it with their line of sight. Solid walls often become invisible while browsing to provide a full view of the environment. After guiding soldiers and determining a plan of attack, it is possible to switch to a much closer tactical view to decide how to attack. The action is done in turns and percentages are used based on the soldiers'' abilities and positions to determine how successful actions are. Terrains are often fully destructible leading to situations where new cover needs to be sought or the strategy needs to be altered after a part of the environment has been blown up. That way both active camouflage and suppressive fire can be used to maneuver around enemies. Soldiers are promoted to a certain class (Assault, Heavy, Sniper or Support) based on their actions in their first mission. Promotions open up access to special support abilities with additional weapons. Soldiers can be fully customized in appearance, abilities (also healing) and loadout. Next to regular weapons some aliens such as the Thin Man can poison soldiers from a distance and later on aliens are introduced with psionic abilities. Through salvaging and research, these also become available to the player. Soldiers that return from the missions need time to heal and cannot be assigned to a new missions right away with full health and abilities, so multiple squads need to be managed.<br><br>For the 70 missions there are ones that are pre-built and are identical for every player. The others (the majority) are randomly generated based on the player''s overall progress. Rather than completely randomizing everything, maps are selected from a pool of 80 with random enemy placement. Usually a mission follows the crash landing of aliens and there are always three countries asking for help. The player can only choose one and that influences the relationship and funding. A decision can be made based on the amount of panic in the region or the reward offered (usually new scientists or engineers). The money is also spent on launching satellites to track alien activity through a holographic view of the Earth called Geoscape, but a lot of them are needed as they only have a limited reach. At the same time satellites are often attacked, so interceptors need to be constructed to defend them. Satellites can only be launched from special silos and cost a lot of money. That way, balanced management is the only way to keep everything under control while a steady growth need to be maintained.<br><br>The campaign can be played in Ironman mode where the game cannot be saved during missions. In one-on-one multiplayer games can be played with a mix of humans and aliens in a single squad, which is not possible in the single-player campaign.

However, the reality is quite different: Roman is poor, has no stable job, and owes money to some dubious individuals. As Niko attempts to help his hapless cousin and pave a more secure future for both of them, he becomes more and more involved in the life of crime.

Following the tradition of the 3D installments of the series, the game is entirely located in one of the three cities of the original GTA, Liberty City, but now in present time, and with an environment reminiscent of GTA III, though bigger and more detailed. Liberty City is heavily based on New York, where the protagonist has to gain respect, welfare and power throughout the game. <br><br>Like in most <i>GTA</i> games, the city map is gradually uncovered during the course of the game. The player starts in Broker (based on Brooklyn), and, in order to access the other three districts of the city (based on the other major boroughs of New York City), has to make progress in the storyline. The game has the usual structure based on missions. The player can sometimes engage in various missions at the same time, and has free access to the non-mission features of the game while being on one.<br><br>Most of the usual elements of exploration and interaction with the city are included in <i>GTA IV</i>. Niko can cause mayhem in the city, hijack cars, listen to radio stations, observe the behavior of the citizens, enter thematic buildings, work as vigilante, taxi driver, or ambulance driver, hire a prostitute, go to a strip club, and so on. Among the new features is the possibility to watch television (with several channels broadcasting various fictional programs) and connect to a fictional Internet, with functional websites (mostly of a humorous nature) created specifically for the game, and an e-mail program. Other additions include looking for criminals in the police department database from a police car, hiring taxi cabs to safely travel to selected destinations, extensive usage of the mobile phone, improved A.I. of the pedestrians, and others. <br><br>Some features from the previous games are missing, such as drivable airplanes and a few other vehicle types. Niko retains the ability to swim and engage in romantic relationships with female characters, features first introduced in San Andreas. However, the light role-playing elements (training to increase stamina, eating, etc.) from the previous entry have been removed. <br><br><i>GTA IV</i>  focuses on third-person shooter gameplay more than the previous installments; most of the missions have larger portions dedicated to on-foot navigation and shooting. Crouching, leaning, and taking cover play a more important role in combat. Hand-to-hand combat has also been re-designed, Niko being able to execute more precise moves. <br><br>The game uses the euphoria motion engine, an alternate middleware solution much like ragdoll physics, which makes all people in the game world move realistically depending on the situation around them. For example, every time Niko enters a car, a different animation will be generated depending on his position relative to the car.<br><br>A new feature compared to the predecessors is the multiplayer. The same free-roaming environment is offered for up to 16 players (32 in the Windows version) in 15 modes.

It is a first-person shooter where the basic weaponry is enhanced with a nanosuit that provides additional abilities, as featured in the first game. Many basic elements from its predecessor are borrowed, with the change of scenery as a notable difference; the game moves away from the jungle environment on a tropical island, as featured in Crytek''s earlier title Far Cry as well, to a darker urban warfare scenery set in the destroyed cityscape of a future New York City in 2023, three years after the events of the first game.<br><br>The player assumes the role of Alcatraz, a force recon marine and a different protagonist than in the first game. New York City is ravaged and partially under martial law after an outbreak of the Manhattan virus that causes cellular breakdown. At the same time the city is struck by an infestation of the alien race Ceph, which was also present in the original game. Alcatraz is initially deployed as a regular marine as a part of C.E.L.L., a private military organization part of Crynet who developed the nanosuit. During the course of an early mission Alcatraz ends up by himself and meets the infected major Laurence Barnes who owns an updated 2.0 version of the suit. He passes it on to Alcatraz who consequently has to take on the Ceph as well as fight off C.E.L.L. soldiers, who assume he is Barnes because of the suit. Crynet hunts Barnes because he is an active biohazard through the infection and has stated criticism of the side effects that come along with wearing the suit.<br><br>Most of the game takes place fighting through the city, but there are also minor parts where a vehicle can be driven. Next to melee attacks (stomping, kicking, punching), a large number of weapons and explosives, there is a large focus on the abilities of the nanosuit, as implied by the game''s promotional slogan &quot;Be the Weapon&quot;. The suit has a limited amount of energy that needs to be recharged regularly. The suit''s four modes of the original game have been brought back to two. Aside from the default Weapon mode, players can access Cloak and Armor as the two main modes. Cloaks provides invisibility and suppresses sounds, while Armor strengthens protection. The suit can further be customized through many modules that provide specific abilities. Speed and Jump are still presented as additional abilities, but they are activated automatically when the player sprints or holds down the jump button respectively. These, along with many other modules, are called passive secondary powers because they drain energy when they are activated. In the other, secondary Tactical mode, items, buildings and enemies can be tagged through a tactical visor. This leaves the player in a vulnerable position with no weapon, but consumes no energy. A major difference to the first game is that multiple suit powers can be enabled at the same time. Other abilities are hit detection (shows the general direction of incoming bullets) and different weapon attachments.<br><br>The suit modes allow for different approaches to levels, based on brute force or stealth. A HUD shows a tactical radar with a basic map of the immediate terrain, nearby enemies, and a stealth meter that shows whether enemies are aware of your presence. Freedom of movement is more restricted than in the first game through the narrower city design, but there are many ways to progress through levels, and a larger focus on the verticality of the environment and using objects for cover and stealth, along with parkours-like movement that includes sliding and climbing up ledges.<br><br>The included multiplayer modes support up to twelve players simultaneously. The game modes are Instant Action (free for all), Team Instant Action (team-based death match), Crash Site (steal energy from alien pods), Assault (nanosuit operatives must download data from terminals defended by black ops soldiers), Capture the Relay, and Extraction (extract alien bio-ticks from defended locations).<br><br>The game supports stereoscopic 3D.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows XP<br/>Processor: Core 2 Duo 2 Ghz</>RAM: 3 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 9 GB<br/>Video: GeForce 8800GT or Radeon 3850<br/>Sound: Yes', 16, 'front.jpg#back.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#YOUTUBE#Xa1NvpiwqQk', 'N');

Typical game elements that return are hunting animals (rhinos, pigs, bears, eagles, wolves, elephants ...) to craft upgrades, collecting plants for syringes, exploring locations for loot that can be sold at shops, trading points and sherpas, and a large amount of weapons including a bow, both melee weapons and long-ranged guns, grenades, mines, and explosives. It is possible to ride elephants as well. Next to the main quest there are various side quests and random karma events for separate karma points. Next to money and experience gained to level up, skills points are provided. These can be spent in The Tiger (aggressive) or The Elephant (defensive) skill tree. There are also a large amount of collectibles such as propaganda posters, masks, lost letters and pages of Mohan Ghale''s journal.<br><br>Bell towers can be climbed to remove the fog from sections of the map. There are 24 outposts to infiltrate and four large fortresses. It is possible to reset outposts to take them over using another tactic. Guns for hire tokens can be used to call in back-up for tough missions. Just like the previous game a stealth approach is always possible. Ajay can shoot open cages or throw bait to use wild animals to cause havoc. Stones can be thrown as a distraction. Both animals and enemies can be tagged with the camera to track movement. An indicator shows if Ajay has been discovered and guards have different alert states. Enemies can be taken out silently using a takedown, a throwing knife, weapons with a suppressor or the bow. The hunter is a new type of enemy that moves silently and can only be tagged for a short time. They quickly disappear, attempt to take you out and can charm animals to attack you. The game has a day and night cycle and Ajay can now sleep in a bed for a certain amount of time to skip the night for instance.<br><br>The single-player campaign can be played cooperatively (except for the main story missions). When playing alone and in a difficult situation, you can send a request for help for someone to join you, and vice versa. Online multiplayer is also supported through Battles of Kyrat, with different types of game modes such as Outpost, Demon Mask or Propaganda. Players who do not own the game can be invited to play along using a limited amount of keys. A level editor is included as well.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows 7 64 bits<br/>Processor: i5-750 or x4 955</>RAM: 4 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 30 GB<br/>Video: GeForce GTX 460 or HD5850<br/>Sound: Yes', 18, 'front.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#6.jpg#7.jpg#8.jpg#9.jpg#10.jpg#11.jpg#12.jpg#13.jpg#14.jpg#15.jpg#16.jpg#17.jpg#18.jpg#19.jpg#20.jpg#21.jpg#22.jpg#23.jpg#24.jpg#25.jpg#26.jpg#27.jpg#28.jpg#29.jpg#30.jpg#31.jpg#32.jpg#33.jpg#34.jpg#35.jpg#YOUTUBE#-P6FXTxBON8', 'N');

The Founders want Columbia to remain a city only for pure Americans while the Vox Populi think the city should be available to anyone. The setting is built around the idea of exceptionalism with a strong religious doctrine and open racism. Elizabeth is a key piece within this conflict and has a mysterious origin including her powers to cause tears in the fabric of space-time, exposing parallel universes. Booker and Elizabeth remain together most of the game and she acts on her own. She does not need to be defended, tosses ammo and silver eagle coins to Booker and can be asked to pick locks. They are hunted down by the spiritual leader Comstock and his troops, along with the giant mechanical Songbird.<br><br>The game uses similar gameplay styles and mechanics found in previous <i>BioShock</i> games. Vigors give the player super powers to do a variety of things such as sending a murder of crows to peck away enemies or charming enemies to defend you. Another one is possession used to take over humans or machines to temporarily turn them into allies. Once the effect wears off, the possessed humans will commit suicide. Most vigors have multiple uses either as a direct attack or as a much stronger trap awaiting to be triggered. Booker can also be upgraded through four types of gear with permanent bonuses similar to the gene tonics in the previous games. Different types can be equipped according to the situation. The typical FPS array of weapons can be found throughout the game like pistols, shotguns, and rifles. One of the more notable weapons is the Sky Hook which can be used as a melee weapon to take down an enemy. Money can be exchanged at vending machines for upgrades and consumables. Items are found by looting barrels, desks and enemies. Vigors can only be executed when a sufficient amount of salt has been collected. The three main bars visible on the screen (health, salt and shield) can be extended by locating and using infusions. The story is also furthered through optional voxophones (audio logs) and kinetoscopes (film projectors).<br><br>Skylines provide a unique way to move throughout the world.

It is set primarily in the near future of 2025 with one third of the game also taking place in the late 1980s. The timelines and story are connected through the playable characters of Alex Mason and Frank Woods in the past, and David Mason  the son of Alex Mason  in the future timeline. The future missions also feature an aged Woods giving exposition for the 1980s backdrop and share the same villain, Raul Menendez, who''s decades long vendetta is the primary focus of the single player campaign. The plot centers on a new cold war between China and The United States over REE (Rare Earth Elements) and its manipulation by Menendez. It has an emphasis on unmanned drones and other robotic technology  a first for the series. Another first for the series is the ability to customize multiplayer-style loadouts before each mission as well as a far less linear campaign. The player can now make choices throughout the storyline that can affect small aspects such as the appearance of NPCs all the way to major decisions that can change the ending entirely. There are new sandbox-style missions dubbed Strike Force. Playing similar to a real-time strategy game, these missions give the player the opportunity to command troops and drones from an overhead view but with the option to zoom into any one of the units, at which point the gameplay switches to standard first-person shooter controls and gameplay. Strike Force is implemented within the campaign and has repercussions on the storyline depending on how the player performs. <br><br>Multiplayer comes with familiar game modes (Deathmatch, Domination, Kill Confirmed, etc)  and ranking. The loadout system has however been changed to a new ten-point system that is unlike any prior title in the series. Players are given 10 points to use on weapons, attachments, and perks, each costing 1 point. The game also introduces wildcards, players can choose up to 3, which allows players to break the rules of create-a-class by either, having three attachments on their primary weapon, two perks of the first tier, or more lethal grenades, but more points are used. The playercard, stats tracking and emblem creation from <i>Black Ops</i> return as well as theater mode and combat training (which is now integrated into multiplayer as a playlist). Dedicated servers return to the PC version albeit with restrictions. Players cannot host servers themselves; rather Activision hosts them and they must still be joined through the now standard matchmaking system. Killstreaks have been renamed scorestreaks as points now factor in as well as kills  encouraging less camping and more playing of the objective. New scorestreaks include lightning strikes (similar to napalm strikes and mortar strikes of the past), unmanned dragonfire drones which hunt down and kill enemy players, among others. Returning strikes include dogs, RC-XD exploding cars, and franchise standards such as the UAV and care packages. <br><br>The <i>Call of Duty: Elite</i> service is now free and new league matches have been introduced.

The story picks up after the events of the supplementary novels <i>Dragon Age: Asunder</i> and <i>The Masked Empire</i> describing a civil war in Orlais between the loyalists of the ruling Empress and a noble faction led by her cousin Grand Duke Gaspard. After the events of Dragon Age II  the Circle of Magi has gone rogue and the mages are at war with the Templar Order seceded from the Chantry. The player''s character enters the game world from the Fade, a breach to another dimension caused by an explosion at a peace conference between mages and templars. Many clerics, including their leader the Divine, are killed and initially the player''s character is held responsible for that, as the only survivor to come out of the blast. The character has however no memory of what has happened, but discovers powers that are capable of closing rifts as is then referred to as the Herald of Andraste. The initial premise is to close these rifts, with the help of the former associates of the Divine, Cassandra and Leliana, former templar Cullen and ambassador Josephine. Following the Divine''s last orders they establish the Inquisition, an independent group to close the rifts and bring those behind it to justice.<br><br>True to the spirit of the series the character can be customized for appearance, sex, class and race. The available races are dwarf, elf, human, and Qunari and the classes are mage, rogue, and warrior with three specializations each. To grow the Inquisition experience needs to be earned by completing quests, which allows the player to further define allegiances and pursue romances. A custom party can be defined and each member benefits from experience as it opens up access to better weapons and more abilities. Power points open up new areas and Inquisition points define the influence over the region; each new level provides a perk that benefits the entire Inquisition. The main hub for quests is the Inquisition''s war table. The War Council consists of Cassandra (also available as a party member), as well as Cullen, Josephine and Leliana. The latter three advisers can be assigned tasks to complete on their own to progress, unlocking new characters, quests and areas.<br><br>The party of four travels to different regions, mainly with the main goal to close a rift and defeat a rival faction, but there are also many sidequests not related to the main story, along with the allegiance towards templars or mages which offers separate missions, and character quests to please specific characters, often for romantic purposes. Each main mission has a recommended level to start and there are multiple difficulty levels. For combat the game can be played as an action RPG, controlling one character while the AI handles the other three, or using a more tactical approach. In the tactical mode the game is paused and orders can be issued. There are also many more details for enemies shown then, such as the HP, strengths and weaknesses. By holding a button the action can be started and as soon as it is released the game pauses again. Even when approaching it an an action RPG you still define the abilities of the other party members through skill trees and you can guide their general approach, such as aggressive or rather relying on defense. Weapon and equipment management through an inventory is also present as well as crafting based on recipes.<br><br>Multiplayer is available for up to four players, working cooperatively with quests separate from the single-player game, a first for the series.

The commander is an additional player who sees the level from an overhead map, gives orders to the team members and can assign missile strikes.

The interface has also undergone massive changes. Besides a new quick slot bar in which the player can assign up to eight abilities for quick access to the number keys, the pause menu has been changed to give the player faster and better control over his teammates. It''s now also possible to give every teammate individual orders instead of having both do the same thing.

This time it is set during World War I and it is inspired by the historic events. Like most of the main games in the series it combines a single-player campaign with an extensive amount of multiplayer modes. The campaign consists of six large missions, dubbed War Stories, each with a different protagonist, a different setting and distinct gameplay elements. The prologue &quot;Storm of Steel&quot; is experienced through the eyes of several Harlem Hellfighters in France and &quot;Through Mud and Blood&quot; is about controlling a tank in France as a British driver. &quot;Friends in High Places&quot; takes it to the skies in France and England as a fighter pilot for the Royal Flying Corp and in &quot;Avanti Savoia&quot; you are a member of the Arditi in Italy. In &quot;The Runner&quot; you are an ANZAC runner in Turkey and the final story &quot;Nothing is Written&quot; is about controlling a Bedouin warrior commanded by Lawrence of Arabia in Mesopotamia.

There are seven game modes: Air Superiority, Conquest, Domination, Operations, Rush, Team Deathmatch, and War Pigeons. Rush, Conquest, Team Deathmatch, and Domination all return from <i>Battlefield 4</i>. Air Superiority was introduced in Battlefield 3: End Game.<br><br>War Pigeons is a team based mode where up to 24 players need to work together to locate pigeons. Once captured, a pigeon needs to be held and defended by the team, while the other team attempts to kill that player. While it is held, a message is being written and once completed the pigeon is released and the message provides the location of the enemy forces for the friendly artillery to rain down on them. The team then receives a point. Pigeon progress is sustained when it is dropped. It can also be shot when it is released and in the air, denying the point and artillery. The message is written the quickest by standing still; shooting and moving slows down the writing.<br><br>The Operations game mode builds on the concept of Rush with offence and defense. The map is split up in sectors the offensive side needs to secure. When both control points of a sector are captured, they own the sector. This goes on for several sectors until a final one is captured, but the attackers have limited respawns. The main difference is that the game takes place across several maps and the back-and-forth is turned into a large military campaign where one environment continues where the previous one ended. Attackers only have three waves to capture all maps to win the entire match. The limited respawns can be countered by using medics and the attackers receive special vehicles that allow for a big push forward. Every map has a specific type: Airship L30 (zeppelin), Armored Train, or Dreadnought (naval vessel).<br><br>Multiplayer has eight distinct classes: Assault, Cavalry, Elite, Medic, Pilot, Scout, Support, and Tanker. A new element is the introduction of a persistent squad where a team of up to five players can remain together as a single unit, even when moving between different servers. Warbonds is the in-game currency used to buy items and gear. There are many authentic weapons such as artillery, flamethrowers, hand guns and small arms, machine guns, many types of rifles, shotguns and mustard gas. Gas can countered by wearing a mask, but this limits both hearing and viewing. Weapons have many types of customization options. There is also a large amount of melee weapons divided in two groups to support the trench based combat including bayonets, clubs, sabres and shovels. Armed vehicles include aircraft, battleships tanks, trucks, and zeppelin.

Guardians are resurrected by the gods from a past life to defend the world, while Defiants are sent back through machines from a future where the dragons were victorious. Players are urged to work together on closing the rifts, as they can affect the environment permanently. When the monsters establish a foothold, the attacks evolve into a full-fledged invasion and finally total war. While the rifts are open, all regular quests get more dangerous and save cities get overrun. That way, players all need to chip in to return the regular order, or live with the increased difficulty. Each player can contribute in some way, regardless of their level.<br><br>An important part of character building is done through Souls. These are spirits of legendary figures from Telara''s past and come with a specific fighting style, healing and spells. Earned points can be invested into a specific ability of a soul, choosing the defensive abilities of one soul and the healing of another for instance. The chosen investments can afterwards be rearranged and saved as separate configurations (roles) to adapt quickly to a different situation. The player can only bond with souls that match their chosen Calling and these provide an unique Soul skill tree. Each Calling has eight possible soul paths. To progress, the player needs to invest soul points into a specific path and these points are provided through levelling. The soul tree has two options for levelling; either branches (specific abilities or bonuses) or roots (base abilities). Roots are generally unlocked after investing in specific branches.<br><br>The GUI is typical for an MMORPG. It shows the character from a third-person perspective, along with standard elements such as a character display, panel buttons, a chat window, an action and inventory bar, quest stickies, a mini-map, and icons for buff and debuff. Character statistics are defined through 20 categories such as strength, intelligence, valor, block, and attack power. Specific perks and quests only become available through a separate guild panel. Players can group into raids, from six to twenty people, and appoint a leader. The player also has access to pets, companions and mounts, and there is a separate skill to craft items through recipes. Items can be sold through auctions or traded with another player. Quests are generally provided through NPCs or objects with a green exclamation mark.<br><br>Next to the basic story, players can access Warfronts through a separate panel. These are instances of Player vs. Player combat based on four game modes: Martyrdom (hold an item as long as possible, but you receive damage while it is in your possession), Capture the Flag, Domination, and Conquest.#REQUISITOS#OS: Windows XP, Vista or 7<br/>Processor: Dual Core 2.0 GHz or better<br/>RAM: 2 GB<br/>Hard Drive: 15.0 GB available<br/>Video: Nvidia GeForce FX 5900, ATI/AMD Radeon X300, Intel GMA X4500 or better.<br/>Sound: DirectX 8.1 compliant card', 12, 'front.jpg#back.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#6.jpg#7.jpg#8.jpg#9.jpg#10.jpg#11.jpg#12.jpg#13.jpg#14.jpg#15.jpg#16.jpg#17.jpg#18.jpg#19.jpg#20.jpg#21.jpg#22.jpg#23.jpg#24.jpg#25.jpg#26.jpg#27.jpg#28.jpg#29.jpg#30.jpg#31.jpg#32.jpg#33.jpg#34.jpg#35.jpg#36.jpg#37.jpg#38.jpg#39.jpg#40.jpg#41.jpg#42.jpg#43.jpg#44.jpg#45.jpg#46.jpg#47.jpg#48.jpg#49.jpg#50.jpg#51.jpg#52.jpg#53.jpg#54.jpg#55.jpg#56.jpg#57.jpg#58.jpg#59.jpg#60.jpg#61.jpg#62.jpg#YOUTUBE#qhAjTUiHOQU', 'N');

As Tetsuhiko Kikuchi''s influence is heavy here, the game is, in some ways, like a spiritual successor to the aforementioned Saturn title.<br><br><i>Code of Princess</i> follows a typically &quot;anime&quot; plot about a princess whose kingdom is being overrun by monsters, and a motley crew of characters that meet and join together to overthrow the evil monsters and the reason the monsters are there.  Primary focus is on the character Solange as she wields a massive sword known as the deLuxcalibur, which is a sacred artifact of sorts for her kingdom.  She is joined by several other characters, most of whom are playable in the story mode of the game.<br><br>Each stage is a fairly straight-forward side-scrolling affair more focused on intense combat than any amount of exploration. Each character uses the same basic controls, but all are played very differently.  Many combat moves are performed in a style similar to a fighting game, such as pressing down, towards, and the A or B button.  Players may typically move between 2-4 planes of action on the stage moving forward or back in the 3D space, and doing so is often part of the strategy of moving through levels.  Typically, a note at the top of the screen will give the current objective for the level or individual wave during the level, such as &quot;defeat all enemies,&quot; &quot;defeat the boss&quot; (which makes the other enemies more of a distraction), &quot;save a villager,&quot; or even simply to survive for a set period of time.  <br><br>Since levels and missions tend not be be very long they are very numerous and players will find themselves leveling up frequently.  Each level allows the player to assign skill points (generally 5 points) to any of six attributes:  Vitality (life), Piety (maximum magic), Attack, Defense, Mind (magic strength), and Speed.  Various status effects may affect the player throughout the game as well including burning, shock, stone, dark (draining magic), or poison.  <br><br>Each main story character not only plays differently, but they level up independently of one another, so that players may choose customize each character differently.  For instance, Solange is naturally a bit slow, but fairly powerful, so a player may build on these strengths adding new speed and ramping up her strength even more.  The character Ali is already pretty fast, so players may want to customize based on that, while other characters are more magic-based, or various combinations of strength, magic, speed, etc.<br><br>Besides the regular story missions, there is a Free Play mode that allows players to replay any story mission without lengthy cut scenes or dialog, and there are Bonus missions which unlock parallel to the Story.  Often, they operate as elements to deepen the overall story experience through the gameplay, or simply to add new twists that aren''t part of the main story, such as fighting a boss a second time after the boss has, essentially received a &quot;second wind&quot; and called in some support.  Bonus Missions also tend to be more challenging, with many of them greatly exceeding the difficulty of the regular story missions, leaving these to be &quot;pro&quot; challenges or challenges for those players willing to replay missions enough to level up several times more.<br><br>During combat, players may lock-on to a single enemy, which allows the player to deal heavier damage to said enemy.  On top of this, activating a Burst gradually drains the magic meter, but also increases all attacks on every enemy.  Combining this with a lock-on allows a player to deal massive damage with every attack.  There is also a shop where players may buy better weapons, armor, and the like--though it is fairly small compared to a traditional RPG.<br><br>Finally, the game also uses the Nintendo Network for local and online co-op and versus play, complete with leaderboards.  This mode also allows players to use more than just the main eight main protagonist characters--practically every single enemy character in the game can be unlocked to be used in this mode, from the simplest soldier characters to massive dragons and even boss characters.

The party consists of Tiz Arrior, a young man whose village was destroyed by a Great Chasm; Agnès Oblige, the Wind Crystal vestal who seeks to awaken all four crystals at the urging of her cryst-fairy companion Airy; Ringabel, a devil-may-care cad with amnesia; and Edea Lee, a former Sky Knight who turned against her country and comrades in order to assist Agnès with her quest.<br><br>The game is considered a &quot;traditional&quot; Japanese RPG in that it sticks to classic mechanics such as accumulation of experience points, the equipping of weapons and armor, item usage, and turn-based combat. <i>Bravely Default</i> is heavily influenced by the Final Fantasy series, to the point where various spells and items are named identically to those in Final Fantasy (like Fire, Fira, and Firaga, or Phoenix Downs), and similar job classes. <i>Bravely Default</i> uses a job system where the characters are assigned a job class, and they earn &quot;Job Points&quot; in battle which go toward leveling up that character in that particular job. Each level brings with it new skills for the characters to use; the maximum job level is 14. Each job has a default ability assigned to the character while they hold that job; a secondary ability can also be selected from among the other jobs that have been unlocked. Skills can be equipped cross-job for each character as well. To unlock a job, the player must defeat an antagonist with that job class, either in the main story or through a side-quest.<br><br>Combat is, on the surface, a standard turn-based system where the player selects actions from a menu for each character and then each character acts in turn according to their speed stat. <i>Bravely Default</i> distinguishes itself via its use of &quot;Brave Points&quot; (BP), with at least one given to each character every turn. To act, the player must spend a BP for that character. Choosing &quot;Default&quot; from the battle menu lets the selected character bank a point, to be used in future turns or to be spent on actions that may require extra BP. Choosing &quot;Brave&quot; as an option allows the character to act more than once per turn, with a maximum of four actions allowed. The character need not have BP banked to use the &quot;Brave&quot; option; extra turns are essentially bought on credit, paid back by not having character act for that number of future turns. In battle a player may also activate &quot;Bravely Second,&quot; which stops time and allows one character four actions (BP is not consumed). In order to use Bravely Second, the player needs &quot;Sleep Points,&quot; which are earned by leaving the 3DS system in sleep mode with the game still running. The player earns one point for every six hours the system sleeps, for a maximum of three points stored.<br><br><i>Bravely Default</i> makes extensive use of the StreetPass functionality of the 3DS. Passing players are stored in the game, and can be summoned during battle to perform an action; the type and effectiveness of the action depends on how far the other player has gotten in the game, how much they''ve leveled up, the strength of their characters, and the skills they''ve learned. It does not cost anything to summon a friend, but that player cannot be summoned again until they have been tagged again via StreetPass. <i>Bravely Default</i> also features a mini-game to rebuild Tiz''s home village of Norende; StreetPass-tagged players are added to the village''s population and can be used to help rebuild the businesses in Norende. Rebuilt businesses will give the players free items occasionally. The town also comes under attack from monsters generated by StreetPass visitors; these monsters can be battled at any time and yield generous XP, JP, and items.<br><br>The Western versions of <i>Bravely Default</i> are localized from an updated version of the original release, with the update called <i>Bravely Default: For the Sequel</i> in Japan.

TMs (Technical Machines) can now be reused as much as the player wants, reflecting the change in their function in the main series <i>Pokémon</i> games. Moves now have ranks, and will progress toward the next rank each time it is used. Another new feature is mini-games, which are hosted by Beartic. Depending on how well the player did, they may receive different prizes from completing mini-games.', 7, 'front.jpg#back.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#YOUTUBE#EMY8rFreuqI', 'N');

The goddess Palutena has called upon her greatest servant, Pit, to jump into the fray to defend Palutena''s honor and to take out all the Underworld forces.  Pit flies over a variety of landscapes and environments and into the fray through intense ground missions.  Palutena has only enough power to grant Pit the power of flight for five minutes, during which time, Pit must reach his next destination.  Afterwards, Pit takes the fight to the ground.  The story is told through fully voice-acted dialog during gameplay, with character art appearing on the lower screen.  <br><br>The basic gameplay is a shooter similar to Sin & Punishment: Star Successor, where players move Pit with the Circle Pad and target enemies with the touch-screen.  Firing shots is performed with the L button.  There is a lefty mode handled with the Circle Pad Pro, but no dual-analog/Circle Pad option.  Each stage is broken up into two segments:  An aerial segment with Pit flying to his destination, and a ground segment with Pit venturing towards a goal (typically with a boss) on foot.  Basic controls are largely the same for both segments with some exceptions.  On foot, players can swing the camera around by swiping the touch-screen, as well as access a variety of Powers.  During aerial segments, the camera is automatic and there are two Special Attack icons which are filled during combat.<br><br>Players have numerous Powers that can be obtained and used.  Powers are organized in a grid, and each power has a geometric shape associated with it.  More powerful abilities have larger or more elaborate shapes, and there is an element of Tetris to organizing the Powers in the grid.  These Powers run the gamut of inflicting poison damage, recovering health, jumping, effect recovery, alternate weapons (lasers, mines, etc), and several others.  Powers are typically discovered through regular gameplay and hidden among the ground-based segments of the stages.  Higher difficulties may yield higher quality Powers.  Players may save up to four different sets of Powers for solo gameplay.<br><br>Like Powers, weapons are also numerous and featured in a wide variety of categories.  There are nine types of weapons:  Staffs, Bows, Clubs, Orbitars, Blades, Claws, Palms, Cannons, and Arms.  While each weapon has both shooting and melee abilities, different weapon types yield different strengths and weaknesses to each ability.  Cannons and Orbitars, for instance, are great at long-range combat.  Clubs, Claws, and Arms on the other hand are superior melee weapons often with short distances in their shooting range, but yielding immense power in close-quarters.  Beyond the standard traits of the styles of weapons, each weapon also has a star rating evaluating their melee and ranged strengths, as well as an overall value giving an idea to how much overall power they yield.  There may be numerous types of a single weapon, and beyond category, melee rating, ranged rating, and value--weapons may also carry a variety of unique perks.  These perks range from raising total health, to minimizing the effects of certain attacks, to increasing speed.  Weapons are earned through online play, purchased, or discovered through regular gameplay hidden in chests or secret areas.  And finally, should a player be less than pleased with the weapons they''d obtained, there is always the option to fuse weapons together to create entirely new ones.<br><br>The main currency of the game is hearts, which are generally used for purchasing weapons.  Hearts are factored into the unique difficulty, referred to as &quot;Intensity,&quot; settings of the game, which can be set from 0.0 to 9.9.  Players may &quot;bet hearts&quot; prior to starting a stage by setting higher Intensity settings.  Completing the stage without failing means players earn bonus hearts at the end.  However, each time a player dies, the Intensity drops ten levels, so a level set to 6.6 will drop to 5.6.  Higher Intensity settings yield more than just bonus hearts, however.  Stages routinely feature closed-off sections with numbers over the gates indicating that they can only be entered with an Intensity setting at least as high as noted.  Beyond that, treasures are likely to contain vastly more powerful weapons than lower Intensity levels.  <br><br><i>Kid Icarus Uprising</i> has a wealth of unlockables and bonus features including an Idol gallery (essentially a character and item art gallery), a practice mode, a music gallery, a mode compatible with AR Cards released for the game (it ships with six randomly selected cards), and over 200 challenges, or achievements, set up in a manner similar to the challenges in Super Smash Bros Brawl.  Up to three AR Cards may be viewed at one time, and if set facing each other, the characters may interact or battle each other.  The game also ships with a free stand for the 3DS system to aid in playing games of this nature.  The game is also compatible with Street Pass and Spot Pass for trading items such as weapons and gems.<br><br>Lastly, <i>Uprising</i> features multiplayer matches for up to six players in both local and online matches, with friends or random players.  The multiplayer matches are generally deathmatch-style affairs in either a free-for-all format or team, 3-versus-3 matches.  Similar to players saving sets of Powers for solo play, they may also save different sets of weapons and Powers for quick access for multiplayer games.  This allows players to set up equipment with various focuses tailored to their gameplay style, or styles, for multiplayer matches.

Fisher has some new moves this time around, and he also has a new weapon always at his disposal; a combat knife. Utilizing the knife, Sam can either kill his enemies, or simply knock them out. At the end of each mission, the player is given an overview of how they did. The more people that the player spares, the better the success score.<br><br>The single-player game is more open-ended than the past two Splinter Cell games. While players are still forced through some areas in a &quot;tunnel&quot; like fashion, with no choice of where to go, there are many instances where they can decide how they''d like to get there. For example, in the caverns, one can either kill two enemies and cross the bridge, or leave them alone, sneak along the side path, and climb a ladder at the end, bypassing the fight entirely, but still winding up in the same location.<br><br>Throughout the game many different locations are visited, such as a lighthouse, a Japanese tea house, Seoul, New York City during an East Coast blackout, and other such exotic locales.<br><br>The Spies-vs-Mercs multiplayer mode that appeared in the previous game has returned, with some new features.

After a chase that also acts as the tutorial, he learns from Catwoman that the Arkham Blackgate prison has been taken over by Black Mask, Joker and Penguin. They each control a different part of the prison (the industrial complex, administration and cell blocks respectively) and have taken hostages. Batman ventures inside to restore order and he can choose which area to tackle first.<br><br>The game is played on a 2D plane, but with the option to move up and down as well. There are also many sequences, for instance when using the grappling hook combined with different camera perspectives, that Batman seemingly moves around as with full 3D movement and many rooms also have multiple vantage points. The game borrows many mechanics from the main games in the series. During combat Batman can punch, kick, counter, evade and string together combos. The grappling hook is used to move around quickly. He can also run, jump, hang from ledges (and do takedowns from there) and shimmy. By touching and holding the screen an analyzer is activated to scan the area. This can highlight objects important to progress and Batman can for instance interact with them by throwing the batarang. A detective mode is activated to highlight objects in yellow and enemies in red by swiping (Vita) or using the circle pad (3DS). In this mode clues can also be revealed to solve side mysteries and sometimes it is the only way to get access to additional WayneTech. Batman can switch between targets, keep track of them, and for instance attack from the air with a glide kick.<br><br>Borrowing elements from the <i>metroidvania</i> genre, the game requires backtracking to open up new routes when certain items have been found, such as an explosive gel or the batclaw, in additional to the batarang provided at the start of the game. There are small amount of stealth, but usually as a means of environment based puzzle solving (i.e. not getting killed instantly) instead of an alternative approach. Batman can for instance rappel up to the rafters or hide in sewer gates. There are one-on-one bossfights and these rely heavily on quick time events. There are also enemies not present in the main <i>Origins</i> game, such as Catwoman and Bronze Tiger.

As with previous games in the series, the gameplay involves gunfights and takes place in a sprawling, open world city where players get around by acquiring transport (cars, boats, helicopters, etc) through less than legal means. Players can roam the game world, complete story missions and partake in various illegal activities, including shooting civilians, robbing people, destruction of cars and the titular act of car theft. These lead to a wanted rating of up to five stars, sending in a police force in pursuit. Continuing to resist the police will also increase it.

One day, Michael discovers his wife in bed with another man, and with Franklin''s help, chases him to a mansion, which they promptly burn to the ground. The mansion, unfortunately, belongs to Mexican drug lord Martin Madrazo, who demands they compensate him for what they did.

Rather, it continues the time progression of battles in the past in the first <i>Black Ops</i> game, modern and near future combat in the second game, and now a game in a far dystopian future set in 2065, 40 years after the previous title. A first for the series, the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions do not have the main single-player campaign, only the multiplayer portion and additional game modes such as Zombies.

It allows them to communicate directly with computers and machines, and it can also be used to read the thoughts and memories of people. The player controls a male or female character and needs the DNI after a failed infiltration and hostage rescue mission from the NCR in Egypt. Your partner, Jacob Hendricks, undergoes the enhancements as well. Five years later the player character and Hendricks are under the command of CIA Agent Rachel Kane investigating a CIA black site in Singapore. Through a series of events the player ends up in Egypt and Switzerland.

As the game is set in the future, various futuristic technologies are available. By progressing through the game new weapons and gadgets are unlocked. The most important ones are the new abilities called Cyber Cores and Cyber Rigs. Cores provide new abilities and attacks, while Rigs influence movement and agility, opening up powerslides, wallruns and boosted jumps. There are three types of Cores and only one can be equipped per loadout. They enable the player character to distract with decoy drones, boost the character in strength or speed, attack or take over robots or keep opponents occupied with swarms of bees.

They each have a callsign, a distinct look, a unique weapon and a unique ability. Four are available right away and the other ones are unlocked gradually. The Specialist classes available at the launch include Battery, Nomad, Outrider, Prophet, Reaper, Ruin, Seraph, Spectre. Ruin for instance has access to Gravity Spikes as a special weapon and Overdrive with enhanced speed as an ability. In certain matches players can vote to protect (keep) or ban certain Specialists, weapons and abilities. The Pick Ten system for custom loadouts from the previous game is still present. Guns can be customized through the Gunsmith feature, for both form and function.<br><br>Unlock tokens are a new element. They are needed to unlock new weapons, attachments, equipment and killstreak awards. They are earned by completing challenges and leveling up. Another type of tokens is used to trade at a Black Market to receive packages with a selection of common or rare items.

The function of perks is altered, as they are now attached to a skill tree with availability dependent on the rank of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skills that they''re associated with. The Intense Training perk is replaced by the optional ability to improve the rank of any one of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skills by leveling up, in the place of selecting a perk. The Pip-Boy can be acquired early on, and provides access to the player''s statistics, inventory, maps, and quest information as in previous games, with the added function of playing mini-games that can be found throughout the Commonwealth. The player can also make use of the Pip-Boy app in order to access the Pip-Boy menu, rather than using the in-game function. HP (health points) and AP (action points) make a return as primary statistics, with the removal of weapon and armor condition. Stimpaks, beds, and other types of consumables such as water or TV dinners can be used to restore HP. Unlike in previous games, exposure to radiation directly influences the player''s max health, and can only be reduced through RadAway or paid assistance from a doctor. AP restores over time, and can be used to sprint or attack using the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.), slowing down time and giving the player the ability to select a target with success in combat dependent on accuracy, which itself is dependent on factors such as weapon range, distance of the target, and obstruction of the target. <br><br>New features include the absence of a level cap, allowing the player to completely max their skills and acquire all perks, fully-voiced male and female protagonists, and an expansive crafting system. The player can cook food, craft drugs, add a wide variety of modifications to weapons and armor, and construct functioning settlements. Settlements may be provided with food, purified water, power, defense systems, housing, and shops that attract merchants and settlers. The player can obtain materials for building by collecting objects that may be deconstructed throughout the wasteland (classified in the Pip-Boy as &quot;junk&quot;) or deconstructing unneeded objects, such as collapsed houses or fallen trees, all of which can be placed in the workshop for later use.<br><br>The story of <i>Fallout 4</i> begins in 2077, in an alternate retro-futuristic timeline that diverged from that of the real world following World War II. In favor of miniaturization of electronics, the world''s governments have focused on developing nuclear energy as a power source, which has led to the creation of power armor, laser weaponry, and housekeeping robots. However, despite these technological advancements, the world is in a state of crisis, as resources are scarce and nuclear war is imminent. During this time, the customizable player character lives a peaceful life in a suburban neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts with their spouse and infant son. However, the peace is interrupted when a Vault-Tec representative knocks on the family''s door. The man informs the player character that their family has recently been approved for entry into the nearby Vault 111, one of many vaults constructed by Vault-Tec as shelter against the threats of a nuclear holocaust. This visit is closely followed by a news report of a nuclear attack, giving the family no other choice but to take shelter in Vault 111, where they are tricked into a state of cryosleep. 210 years later, in the year 2287, the player character emerges from the vault, beginning their journey into a post-apocalyptic wasteland.', 18, 'front.jpg#back.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#6.jpg#7.jpg#8.jpg#9.jpg#10.jpg#11.jpg#12.jpg#13.jpg#14.jpg#15.jpg#16.jpg#17.jpg#18.jpg#19.jpg#20.jpg#21.jpg#22.jpg#23.jpg#24.jpg#25.jpg#26.jpg#27.jpg#28.jpg#29.jpg#30.jpg#31.jpg#32.jpg#33.jpg#34.jpg#35.jpg#36.jpg#37.jpg#38.jpg#39.jpg#40.jpg#41.jpg#42.jpg#43.jpg#44.jpg#45.jpg#46.jpg#47.jpg#48.jpg#49.jpg#50.jpg#51.jpg#52.jpg#53.jpg#54.jpg#55.jpg#56.jpg#57.jpg#58.jpg#59.jpg#60.jpg#61.jpg#62.jpg#63.jpg#64.jpg#65.jpg#66.jpg#67.jpg#68.jpg#69.jpg#70.jpg#71.jpg#72.jpg#73.jpg#74.jpg#75.jpg#76.jpg#77.jpg#78.jpg#79.jpg#80.jpg#81.jpg#82.jpg#83.jpg#84.jpg#85.jpg#86.jpg#87.jpg#88.jpg#89.jpg#90.jpg#91.jpg#92.jpg#93.jpg#94.jpg#95.jpg#96.jpg#97.jpg#98.jpg#99.jpg#100.jpg#101.jpg#102.jpg#103.jpg#104.jpg#105.jpg#106.jpg#107.jpg#108.jpg#109.jpg#110.jpg#111.jpg#112.jpg#113.jpg#114.jpg#115.jpg#YOUTUBE#u_svERdFDbk', 'N');

This time it is set during World War I and it is inspired by the historic events. Like most of the main games in the series it combines a single-player campaign with an extensive amount of multiplayer modes. The campaign consists of six large missions, dubbed War Stories, each with a different protagonist, a different setting and distinct gameplay elements. The prologue &quot;Storm of Steel&quot; is experienced through the eyes of several Harlem Hellfighters in France and &quot;Through Mud and Blood&quot; is about controlling a tank in France as a British driver. &quot;Friends in High Places&quot; takes it to the skies in France and England as a fighter pilot for the Royal Flying Corp and in &quot;Avanti Savoia&quot; you are a member of the Arditi in Italy. In &quot;The Runner&quot; you are an ANZAC runner in Turkey and the final story &quot;Nothing is Written&quot; is about controlling a Bedouin warrior commanded by Lawrence of Arabia in Mesopotamia. Each story has a different approach and offers specific vehicles, weapons or play styles.<br><br>Multiplayer usually supports 24, 32 or 64 players on a single map depending on the game mode and most of these are based on the settings of the single-player War Stories. The game was launched with nine multiplayer maps: Amiens, Argonne Forest, Ballroom Blitz, Empire''s Edge, Fao Fortress, Monte Grappa, Sinai Desert, St. Quentin Scar, and Suez. There are seven game modes: Air Superiority, Conquest, Domination, Operations, Rush, Team Deathmatch, and War Pigeons. Rush, Conquest, Team Deathmatch, and Domination all return from <i>Battlefield 4</i>. Air Superiority was introduced in Battlefield 3: End Game.<br><br>War Pigeons is a team based mode where up to 24 players need to work together to locate pigeons. Once captured, a pigeon needs to be held and defended by the team, while the other team attempts to kill that player. While it is held, a message is being written and once completed the pigeon is released and the message provides the location of the enemy forces for the friendly artillery to rain down on them. The team then receives a point. Pigeon progress is sustained when it is dropped. It can also be shot when it is released and in the air, denying the point and artillery. The message is written the quickest by standing still; shooting and moving slows down the writing.<br><br>The Operations game mode builds on the concept of Rush with offence and defense. The map is split up in sectors the offensive side needs to secure. When both control points of a sector are captured, they own the sector. This goes on for several sectors until a final one is captured, but the attackers have limited respawns. The main difference is that the game takes place across several maps and the back-and-forth is turned into a large military campaign where one environment continues where the previous one ended. Attackers only have three waves to capture all maps to win the entire match. The limited respawns can be countered by using medics and the attackers receive special vehicles that allow for a big push forward. Every map has a specific type: Airship L30 (zeppelin), Armored Train, or Dreadnought (naval vessel).<br><br>Multiplayer has eight distinct classes: Assault, Cavalry, Elite, Medic, Pilot, Scout, Support, and Tanker. A new element is the introduction of a persistent squad where a team of up to five players can remain together as a single unit, even when moving between different servers. Warbonds is the in-game currency used to buy items and gear. There are many authentic weapons such as artillery, flamethrowers, hand guns and small arms, machine guns, many types of rifles, shotguns and mustard gas. Gas can countered by wearing a mask, but this limits both hearing and viewing. Weapons have many types of customization options. There is also a large amount of melee weapons divided in two groups to support the trench based combat including bayonets, clubs, sabres and shovels. Armed vehicles include aircraft, battleships tanks, trucks, and zeppelin. It is also possible to ride a horse into battle.', 3, 'front.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#6.jpg#7.jpg#8.jpg#9.jpg#10.jpg#11.jpg#12.jpg#13.jpg#14.jpg#15.jpg#16.jpg#17.jpg#18.jpg#19.jpg#20.jpg#21.jpg#22.jpg#23.jpg#YOUTUBE#TNvCYyicXvI', 'N');

Searching for players still largely depends on scouting, but there are some new filters. The player search function of the previous version does not return. Tiredness and injuries still have a major impact, but now it is possible to design and save multiple squads and swap them quickly, without going through every change manually each time. It is still possible to become a coach and helpful items can be bought in the FIFA Store. Next to the known offline game modes, the option returns to design a custom tournament.<br><br>The Ultimate Team mode still focuses on collecting players and assembling a team with Ultimate Team Online Seasons as a sub mode. Players are bought as card sets. The transfer market has been reworked to view all available cards for a single player at once and the prices can be compared quickly.

The ability to play together with someone else returns to the Seasons mode, but players who prefer not to go against a team controlled by two players can disable this in the matchmaking. Matchmaking now also immediately searches a new opponent after a game is over.<br><br>The major changes to the gameplay itself focus on tighter through balls. Technical players are able to show their dribbling skills and team mates have an improved run strategy to anticipate the passes. The ball has been made more loose in players'' handling, adding an element of randomness and more types of shots based on player ability, position and power. Theres also a larger chance of defenders deflecting the balls trajectory when in the line of a shot instead of just stopping it. The AI of keepers has been altered in accordance with the gameplay changes, adding in multiple calculation moments (when a ball changes trajectory for instance) and last minute saves.<br><br>A final change is added focus on atmosphere to make the presentation resemble TV broadcoasts more closely.

When humans first set foot on Mars they discovered the Traveler, a giant sphere that then allowed mankind to colonize space quickly. Centuries later the Darkness, an enemy of the Traveler, arrived and waged war against it and all of its creations. The Traveler is forced to scarify itself as a measure of protection and what is left of humanity on Earth is forced to live in a city constructed underneath. The Traveler enlists warriors known as Guardians with special abilities as a personal army. These Guardians are guided by Ghosts, artificial intelligence. The player''s character is found by such a Ghost (acting as a robot companion in the game) and becomes a Guardian.<br><br>At the start the player chooses a class (Titan, Hunter or Warlock - corresponding with the classic Fighter, Rogue and Mage) and then customizes the appearance through race (Human, Awoken or Exo), gender, face, hair and marking. Each class has distinct abilities. The Titan is a fighter with an advanced mech suit, the Hunter is a bounty hunter with a knack for reconnaissance and ranged weapons, and the Warlock is a magical being that uses spells and explosives. Each class has various subclasses (unlocked at level 15) and specific abilities and statistics. None of the weapons in the game are restricted to a single class. The most distinct differences are the grenade types, jump abilities, melee attack and a special ability. The game borrows elements from the MMORPG genre in its design, with the Tower as a main hub zone to interact with NPCs, buy weapons, gear and Ghost upgrades, receive mail, buy and upgrade ships etc. Rewards for completing missions can also usually be collected here. The other major zones are Earth, the Moon, Mars and Venus, with some additional locations. While fighting, movement and jumps are important when confronting enemies. A Guardian can wield up to three main weapons (primary, special and heavy) next to grenades and other abilities. Only one weapon of each type can be equipped, but nine more for each type can be stored in an inventory to swap them.<br><br>Ships are used to travel through space to other planets. These voyages are not an interactive scene however as the game does not have a complete open world design. Each planet has its own story and various quests. Players complete missions by defeating enemies, collecting loot. Glimmer, the main currency is used to buy upgrades, vehicles, emblems ... The character also gains experience and levels up, accessing new abilities. From level 18 Vanguard Marks are unlocked as an additional currency for high-end gear, along with Vanguard Reputation as a reward for completing bounties. There are daily and weekly challenges to earn Marks, but the amount that can be earned has time constrictions. From level 20 the general experience system is replaced by Mote of Light. At that level the characters also gets to join one of three factions: Dead Orbit, New Monarchy or Future War Cult. The main story consists of different campaign missions that need to be completed for The Speaker, unlocked gradually and opened up on Earth, Moon, Venus and Mars respectively. Once unlocked however, they can be completed in any order. Next to the mission progression it is possible to enter a planet in exploration mode, offering free exploration. Each planet generally has five major story missions. These can be completed alone or in groups of six players working together.<br><br>Players can also optionally organize themselves in Fireteams for Strike missions, similar to MMORPG dungeons, that are harder with various mini-bosses and bosses. Fireteams are organized through online matchmaking and it is possible to make them public or private, and invite players. Only in Fireteams is voice chat possible. Outside of it communication is limited to gestures and prompts. Players also do not see all other online players at that location, only a selection. For the instance missions, the player''s character (and possibly other team members) are drawn in a private part in the game, cut off from the open game world. In these section characters can revive each other and there are checkpoints for respawns. Loot is personalized and does not need to be distributed between players. Each planet contains five major loot chests. Certain weapons and armour have a ranking system where they become better over time. There are also various types of engrams, a type of pattern for weapons or amour that can be turned into a special item with colour coding for the rarity level. Decoding them improves a separate ranking system with leveling to access additional engrams. When dead, other players can attempt to revive the player''s character with its Ghost nearby or eventually it respawns. Moving around on planets can be done on speeder bikes.<br><br>There are also Raids, much harder cooperative missions added gradually by the developer that do not support matchmaking and can only be taken on with players at a high level with high-end gear. Unlike Strike missions, no objectives or directions are given, players have to figure it out for themselves. Raids can be paused and resumed, unlike most of the rest of the game, but are reset after a weekly cycle. Competitive multiplayer is available in the The Crucible PvP game mode in a separate location. It offers game modes unlocked gradually including Clash, Control, Skirmish and Rumble. They come with different team sizes and include team deathmatch, capturing zones, team modes with vehicles and more. Level differences between players are nullified except for the skill tree unlocks, but the strength of the gear, weapons and equipped items makes a significant difference.

The Lucians have been able to keep Niflheim at bay, mainly because the capital Insomnia is protected by the Wall, a magical shield powered by a crystal. At the start of the game an armistice is proposed as well as a union of states through the marriage of Prince Noctis of Lucis and Lady Lunafreya of Tenebrae, a separate nation with limited political power due to the influence of a priestess called the Oracle. The game opens when Noctis, the only playable character, travels with his friends Gladiolus, Ignis and Prompto to Accordo where the wedding is to take place. Along the way it is revealed Niflheim has betrayed Lucis and the crystal has been stolen with many important figures killed.

Later on a fast travel option becomes available. The game has many contemporary elements, such as the use of cell phones. There are many cut-scenes and conversations between characters, there are shops to visit, and Ignis uses different ingredients to cook meals. There are several side quests, hunts, optional dungeons and also fishing. The later parts of the game move away from the open world and have a more linear design.<br><br>Combat is done through free movement, much like Final Fantasy Type-0 or the Kingdom Hearts series by the same developer.

Those can also be discarded entirely by rejecting the Outsider''s help and just like the first title it can also be approached as a pure action game with melee and ranged combat, as a pure stealth game or as a mix of everything. Unlike the first game there is no silent protagonist as they both are voiced and speak throughout the game. The game is no longer set in Dunwall except for a short part early on, but in the coastal city Karnaca in the southern part of the Empire of the Isles. Architecture, fashion and technology now draw from 19th century European countries like Greece, Italy and Spain.

Emily''s abilities often focus on distraction and they are Domino to link the fate and actions of two or more characters, Doppelganger to create a clone, Far Reach as a grappling hook, Mesmerize to turn enemies into a dream state and Shadow Walk to turn into smoke for stealth or to move through vents. Corvo''s familiar abilities are Bend Time, Blink, Dark Vision, Devouring Swarm and Possession. Abilities can be upgraded, for instance for Corvo''s Blink to pass through glass without breaking it or Emily''s Far Reach to snatch items harpoon-style. For stealth it is possible to knock out, drag and throw enemies, it is possible to distract using sound and alarms, and guards have an awareness meter based on sound, discoveries and alerting each other, and vision. The rat plague from the original game is replaced by blood flies. They can attack the character, but can also be turned into a distraction. When more enemies are killed, more flies appear.<br><br>Runes need to be discovered or bought at black markets to upgrade the abilities. The bone charm system of the original title returns, but in a new form. Players can now craft custom bone charms after unlocking that power, as equippable items that provide new powers. Bonecharms can add invisibility or invulnerability to specific actions or improve actions such as sprinting or swimming, or the regeneration of health or mana. Next to coins as the main currency, blueprints need to be located to upgrade the arsenal and there are paintings as optional collectibles. Based on the character''s aggressiveness and assassinations, a chaos level is determined which influences the outcome.', 3, 'front.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#6.jpg#7.jpg#8.jpg#9.jpg#10.jpg#11.jpg#12.jpg#13.jpg#14.jpg#15.jpg#16.jpg#17.jpg#YOUTUBE#5coBxRShaMw', 'N');

They include batarangs (now also used as a way to explore the environment), the batclaw, a disruptor, an electrical charge gun, explosive gel, freeze blast, grapnel gun, a line-launcher, a remote hacking device, smoke pellets, a voice synthesizer etc. Many of these return from previous games. Exploration is largely done using long flights with the cape.<br><br>An entirely new game element is the introduction of the batmobile as a playable vehicle for both exploration and combat. While on foot it can be summoned right away and Batman is able to eject to go into flight without interruption. The car is bulletproof, can smash through obstacles and is equipped with weapons. There are two modes to control the vehicle: Battle or Pursuit. Pursuit is used mostly for transportation and driving challenges. Battle provides tank-like controls for the car, with 360-degree range of movement, strafing and a large weapons arsenal.

This game takes place in London in 1868 during the Industrial Revolution. Like many of the earlier games it is told as a simulation played in the present using the Animus technology from the Abstergo company from the viewpoint of an anonymous Assassin initiate. In the present Rebecca Crane and Shaun Hastings clash with the Templars who are searching for a Piece of Eden in modern day London. There are regularly short sequences in modern times, but the game is almost entirely played in the simulation of London following the Assassin twins Jacob and Evie Frye who look for Pieces of Eden. Their main target is also to thwart the Templar Grand Master Crawford Starrick who rules all of London by day and uses the Blighters street gang at night to get his dirty work done. Jacob and Evie need to bring him down by influencing and infiltrating the criminal underground, but also need to take over London with their Rooks gang fighting the Blighters, one area at a time.<br><br>After the initial sequences players can freely swap between Jacob and Evie at any moment in the open world, a first for the series, but they each have their separate main missions. Evie favours a stealth approach and is mostly after the Pieces of Eden, while Jacob is more confrontational in his actions and mainly wants to bring down Starrick. In the background many other Assassins are at work to stop the Templar control over the city. Most side missions are open to any character, but the main ones require a specific character to complete them. The characters have their separate storyline, but these often intersect. There are some separate missions that take place in a very different time as well, due to an Animus glitch that opens rifts in time. Many famous historical characters are a part of the story, such as Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, Florence Nightingale and Charles Dickens. There are also iconic buildings and environment such as Westminster Palace, the Big Ben, the Bank of England, the Tower of London and Buckingham Palace.

Experience is converted into skill points that can be invested in three skill trees: combat, stealth and ecosystem.<br><br>As with previous game exploration and climbing is encouraged through a free running system. It is similar to the one in Assassin''s Creed: Unity with two options to pursue a path up or down. Entirely new to the series is the use of moving trains and driving through London using horse-drawn carriages, including one as a mobile headquarters. This is used to transport people or goods, or chase enemies, but it is also possible to kidnap enemies, put them in a carriage and demand a ransom. A rope launcher can be used to rappel up buildings quickly and it can also used as a zipline (returning from Assassin''s Creed: Revelations) to get down. There is a separate stealth system based on a ring and eagle eye vision. Fighting is done using close combat melee attacks with fists, brass knuckles and canes. There are also ranged weapons with many types of pistols. The system to punch, attack and block/counter is fairly similar to previous games. Enemies can now be beaten into a ''near death'' status where they remain defenseless. When this is done for several enemies, there is an opportunity for spectacular multi-kill finishing moves and executions. With a later skill, performing these can also scare other enemies away.<br><br>Next to the main missions there are various sidequests and activities to earn additional money such as carriage races and fight clubs. Many additional missions are based around territory control, taking over London sector by sector, similar to the gameplay of Assassin''s Creed: Brotherhood. This is done by completing activities and killing rival gang members. To completely secure a sector a large-scale gang war needs to be fought. The presence of Rooks in the area then becomes immediately visible and it is possible to invest in various gang upgrades to make them stronger.

The gameplay borrows and expands upon most of the mechanics introduced in <i>Ground Zeroes</i>, which was a smaller slice in content in anticipation of this title. The game is set in 1984 with Big Boss also known as Punished &quot;Venom&quot; Snake as the protagonist. It takes place in Afghanistan and the border between Angola and Zaire as Big Boss seeks revenge against the Cipher group led by Skull Face who destroyed his forces and almost killed him in <i>Ground Zeroes</i>. At the start of the game he wakes up in a military hospital in Cyprus and is almost immediately attacked by soldiers and a strange, burning creature. Eventually he is rescued by Ocelot, he locates Kaz Miller and the trio then establishes a base to hunt down Cipher and its covert strike force XOF with commander Skull Face.<br><br>The game has a complex story with the typical long cut-scene sequences, but there are fewer and they are shorter compared to earlier <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> titles.

To access advanced tools and weapons, Big Boss needs to complete missions for Miller so he can expand the main Mother Base. The player needs to focus on a consistent flow of the GMP currency to manage the base, research new technologies, hire soldiers and use money during missions for instance to call in an air strike. Next to merely completing missions, a Fulton technology can be used to transport back items, weapons, vehicles and even soldiers with interesting abilities to the Mother Base to use them.

Missions can be played entirely as an action game, but a large amount of mechanics and rewards are based around stealth. He can run, sneak and crawl along with scouting enemy patterns. It is possible to render guards unconscious, kill them or use sound to lure some in a certain direction. Enemies have various alert statuses and will investigate or trigger alarms when they are suspicious or find bodies or destroyed security cameras, changing their patrol routes. There are many entry points going underground, through gates or finding an entry by climbing. Optionally it is possible to take out enemies from far using a sniper rifle or by smuggling an explosive device into the base to blow it up.<br><br>With each new technology new options become available, introducing drones, special types of weapon enhancements, a taser, echolocation and so on.

Players defend their own base and can attack others. This can happen in the middle of a story mission and it is possible to quickly call in friends to help with the defense. This part of the game has microtransactions with real money to speed up certain elements. In October 2015 the console versions were updated with a second multiplayer mode as a successor to Metal Gear Online. There are several game modes where players or team of players fight each other. It has a safe hub inspired by the single-player Africa map, but expanded, where all weapons and abilities can be tested with unlimited ammo before accessing a lobby to play the game.', 3, 'front.jpg#back.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#6.jpg#7.jpg#8.jpg#9.jpg#10.jpg#11.jpg#12.jpg#13.jpg#14.jpg#15.jpg#16.jpg#17.jpg#18.jpg#19.jpg#20.jpg#21.jpg#22.jpg#23.jpg#24.jpg#25.jpg#26.jpg#27.jpg#28.jpg#29.jpg#30.jpg#31.jpg#32.jpg#33.jpg#34.jpg#35.jpg#36.jpg#37.jpg#38.jpg#39.jpg#40.jpg#41.jpg#42.jpg#43.jpg#44.jpg#45.jpg#46.jpg#47.jpg#48.jpg#49.jpg#50.jpg#51.jpg#52.jpg#53.jpg#54.jpg#55.jpg#56.jpg#57.jpg#58.jpg#59.jpg#60.jpg#61.jpg#62.jpg#63.jpg#64.jpg#65.jpg#66.jpg#67.jpg#68.jpg#69.jpg#70.jpg#71.jpg#72.jpg#73.jpg#74.jpg#75.jpg#76.jpg#77.jpg#78.jpg#79.jpg#80.jpg#81.jpg#82.jpg#83.jpg#84.jpg#85.jpg#86.jpg#87.jpg#88.jpg#89.jpg#90.jpg#91.jpg#92.jpg#93.jpg#94.jpg#95.jpg#96.jpg#97.jpg#98.jpg#99.jpg#100.jpg#101.jpg#102.jpg#103.jpg#104.jpg#105.jpg#106.jpg#107.jpg#108.jpg#109.jpg#110.jpg#111.jpg#112.jpg#113.jpg#114.jpg#115.jpg#116.jpg#117.jpg#118.jpg#119.jpg#120.jpg#121.jpg#122.jpg#123.jpg#124.jpg#125.jpg#126.jpg#127.jpg#128.jpg#129.jpg#130.jpg#131.jpg#132.jpg#133.jpg#134.jpg#135.jpg#136.jpg#137.jpg#138.jpg#139.jpg#140.jpg#141.jpg#142.jpg#143.jpg#144.jpg#145.jpg#146.jpg#147.jpg#148.jpg#149.jpg#150.jpg#151.jpg#152.jpg#153.jpg#154.jpg#155.jpg#156.jpg#157.jpg#158.jpg#159.jpg#160.jpg#161.jpg#162.jpg#163.jpg#164.jpg#165.jpg#166.jpg#167.jpg#168.jpg#169.jpg#170.jpg#171.jpg#172.jpg#YOUTUBE#HrdweuF8_Go', 'N');

For example, a defeated orc might want to take revenge on Talion, humiliating him in a similar manner and wear the scars of the previous fight. The Nemesis system also generates the bodyguards, captains and war chiefs of Sauron''s armies. They have their own hierarchy and become stronger as they manage to kill you, rising in the ranks. Captains who manage to beat Talion grow in strength and are promoted, and in time they become a serious challenge and a personal vendetta. Even though there are many fighting sequences, a large amount of stealth is encouraged to avoid overwhelming confrontations until many new weapons and abilities provide a wider range of tackling large groups. Captains can be killed permanently (usually by beheading them with a finisher), or you can choose to have them return at a later time through a regular kill. It is also possible to brand enemies which puts them under your influence.

The two main characters in Hunter''s Dream are the wheelchair-bound Gehrman who provides advice and the life-size doll called Doll who helps leveling up. Next to the hub world it has the interconnect world known from the <i>Dark Souls</i> games.<br><br>Gameplay for combat, movement and exploration is largely similar to the <i>Souls</i> games. The weight statistic has been removed, there is less focus on defense and spells, and more on dodging. Rather than holding down a button, dodging is now an active and timing-based skill. The stamina bar is now more forgiving for multiple actions in succession. The amount of gear is more limited and the statistics are downplayed in favour of fighting skill for specific weapons. The main-hand weapon is generally melee while the off-hand usually holds a firearm mainly for combos and to riposte counter. An aggressive approach is rewarded through a new Regain system where certain attacks are rewarded with health after being hit, removing the need to run away and heal before continuing the fight. Generally health is restored through vials (found or purchased), replacing flasks in the previous games. Through the Insight stat enemy placement and attacks are influenced. Reaching a certain level also often brings new elements into the game world and changes how the world reacts to the protagonist. Some enemies are able to absorb souls, forcing you to reclaim them. Insights is also used as a currency to buy special items and required to summon other players. Next to the main weapons there are ten trick weapons, very powerful ones that have two forms that can be switched on the fly.<br><br>The online element is similar to the previous titles. Allies can be summoned in your world and it is possible to invade other people''s world. Up to three players can play cooperatively (not with private lobbies and passwords) and PvP is one-on-one. PvP is accessible after gaining an Insight rating of 30. Game elements include memoirs, asynchronous notes left behind, spectral appearances as illusions providing tips, and elements that show where other characters died.', 16, 'front.jpg#back.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#6.jpg#7.jpg#8.jpg#9.jpg#YOUTUBE#G203e1HhixY', 'N');

It is an open world racing game set entirely at night that returns to the underground racing and tuning culture best known from the Need for Speed Underground series. The player is a new racer in the fictional city Ventura Bay and soon gets introduced to the local street racing scene, hooking up with the characters Amy, Manu, Robyn, Spike and Travis. The story is told through cut-scenes with full motion video combined with digitized sections, shown from the main character''s first-person perspective. Those five characters each aim to impress five real-life racing icons that are present as actors in the cut-scenes: Akira Nakai, Ken Block, Magnus Walker, Risky Devil and Shinichi Morohoshi.

The crew members regularly keep in touch through phone calls and text messages.<br><br>Next to cash earned in races up upgrade cars and buy new ones, REP is an important currency to progress in the game. With each new level new events are opened up. REP can be earned for five types of activities: Build (customization), Crew (social interactions and synchronized driving), Outlaw (illegal activities), Speed and Style, as well as through actions in the open world environment, especially by combining maneuvers. Each of the activities is tied to one of the five characters of the crew as well as an icon, and the player is free to pursue one the five paths in any order.<br><br>There is a lot of emphasis on tuning the licensed cars for the aesthetics, performance and handling. Many upgrades are based on parts that first need to be won or unlocked. The garage has room for five cars. Customization options include Paint &amp; Wrap to change an entire body kit or design each car element and decals in a custom way. There is also a Wrap Editor with many different types of paint jobs. Handling Tuning focuses most on the difference between drifting or opting for good grip. It is possible to upgrade a starter car to match the fastest ones in the game, so it is not required to sell and buy cars just to keep up. Racing is mainly arcade based and typical race types include standard races to reach the finish first (Sprint), drifting challenges and time based courses. Outlaw missions often include police chases and in some cases it is possible to pay the police a bribe so they halt the chase. There are also daily challenges.<br><br>The game requires a permanent internet connection at all times, even when playing solo. That also means the game cannot be paused during a race. The Autolog from previous titles, where scores and achievements are recorded and shared with friends, is still present. The online multiplayer continues the AllDrive concept of Need for Speed: Rivals. Instead of interacting with all online players, the game creates a lobby or copy of the game world where a maximum of eight online players are present. Participating in races is then done by starting or joining a crew. It is not a permanent organization and mostly resembles the idea of public and private matches. With each new game session a new crew needs to be started or joined, either privately with friends or for instance by joining a public crew. It is also possible to start a race and then bring in all friends of a crew.', 12, 'front.jpg#back.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#6.jpg#7.jpg#8.jpg#9.jpg#10.jpg#11.jpg#12.jpg#13.jpg#14.jpg#YOUTUBE#Y5wssYZHVWc', 'N');

Hotwire is similar to the flags in Conquest, but they are replaced by drivable cars. Just like in Conquest the game is won by capturing them, but the cars need to be driven at a certain speed to reduce the reinforcement tickets for the other side. Up to four players can board a single car and while one drives the other three can lean out of the windows to shoot. The game is won by removing all opposing tickets or by having the most when time runs out. Just like Crosshair, Rescue is played 5-on-5 with sessions that last three minutes and players only have a single life. Law enforcement is represented by S.W.A.T. officers that need to free hostages or kill the criminals. The criminals win by killing all officers.<br><br>Vehicles are generally faster than those in the previous games.

The story picks up after the events of the supplementary novels <i>Dragon Age: Asunder</i> and <i>The Masked Empire</i> describing a civil war in Orlais between the loyalists of the ruling Empress and a noble faction led by her cousin Grand Duke Gaspard. After the events of Dragon Age II  the Circle of Magi has gone rogue and the mages are at war with the Templar Order seceded from the Chantry. The player''s character enters the game world from the Fade, a breach to another dimension caused by an explosion at a peace conference between mages and templars. Many clerics, including their leader the Divine, are killed and initially the player''s character is held responsible for that, as the only survivor to come out of the blast. The character has however no memory of what has happened, but discovers powers that are capable of closing rifts as is then referred to as the Herald of Andraste. The initial premise is to close these rifts, with the help of the former associates of the Divine, Cassandra and Leliana, former templar Cullen and ambassador Josephine. Following the Divine''s last orders they establish the Inquisition, an independent group to close the rifts and bring those behind it to justice.<br><br>True to the spirit of the series the character can be customized for appearance, sex, class and race. The available races are dwarf, elf, human, and Qunari and the classes are mage, rogue, and warrior with three specializations each. To grow the Inquisition experience needs to be earned by completing quests, which allows the player to further define allegiances and pursue romances. A custom party can be defined and each member benefits from experience as it opens up access to better weapons and more abilities. Power points open up new areas and Inquisition points define the influence over the region; each new level provides a perk that benefits the entire Inquisition. The main hub for quests is the Inquisition''s war table. The War Council consists of Cassandra (also available as a party member), as well as Cullen, Josephine and Leliana. The latter three advisers can be assigned tasks to complete on their own to progress, unlocking new characters, quests and areas.<br><br>The party of four travels to different regions, mainly with the main goal to close a rift and defeat a rival faction, but there are also many sidequests not related to the main story, along with the allegiance towards templars or mages which offers separate missions, and character quests to please specific characters, often for romantic purposes. Each main mission has a recommended level to start and there are multiple difficulty levels. For combat the game can be played as an action RPG, controlling one character while the AI handles the other three, or using a more tactical approach. In the tactical mode the game is paused and orders can be issued. There are also many more details for enemies shown then, such as the HP, strengths and weaknesses. By holding a button the action can be started and as soon as it is released the game pauses again.

Compared to DOOM³ the areas are wider with more focus on verticality and rewarding an offensive approach, doing away with the slower horror aspect based on scares.<br><br>The single-player campaign consists of thirteen levels. It is set on Mars on a research facility of Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC). The facility has been able to solve an energy crisis on Earth by channeling energy from Hell into a renewable power source called Argent energy.

When the player''s character, referred to as the Doom Marine, wakes up in a sarcophagus-like prison, a full invasion from Hell is already in progress. The initial goal is to push back the invasion with the assistance of UAC research chief Samuel Hayden. Later on the focus shifts to stopping Olivia Pierce who heads a cult that wants to use the energy of the Argent Tower to bring all demonic armies through the portal.

Weapons such as the plasma gun, shotgun, heavy assault rifle, rocket launcher, lightning gun etc. can be upgraded with different points also earned during combat. In addition floating combat support drones can be used to modify weapons, often adding secondary firing modes. Next to the regular selection all weapons can be accessed directly through a weapon wheel while time is slowed down.

Killing enemies provides a small amount of health, but larger amounts can be acquired through glory kills. When enemies receive a certain amount of damage they stagger with a blue highlight. When close enough they turn orange and a dynamic glory kill finisher can be performed, different based on the angle. These glory kills can often be used to chain attacks together. Melee attacks are also possible as well as using explosive items in the environment. The chainsaw weapon has a specific use. It requires fuel and does a lot of damage, with fuel consumption based on the strength of the enemy. A chainsaw kill is rewarded with additional ammo for the regular weapons.

The Zombies mode is now set in Morg City and introduces four new characters: Nero the Magician, Jessica the Femme Fatale, Vincent the Cop and Campbell the Boxer.<br><br>Another new game mode is Freerun where players can run through obstacle courses using the new abilities to get the fastest times. When the regular campaign is finished, the Nightmare campaign is unlocked. It remixes the original campaign with different enemies such as zombies, random weapons instead of loadouts, and the use of power-ups.', 18, 'front.jpg#back.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#6.jpg#7.jpg#8.jpg#9.jpg#10.jpg#11.jpg#12.jpg#13.jpg#14.jpg#15.jpg#16.jpg#17.jpg#18.jpg#19.jpg#20.jpg#21.jpg#22.jpg#23.jpg#24.jpg#25.jpg#26.jpg#27.jpg#28.jpg#29.jpg#30.jpg#31.jpg#32.jpg#33.jpg#34.jpg#35.jpg#36.jpg#37.jpg#38.jpg#39.jpg#40.jpg#41.jpg#42.jpg#43.jpg#44.jpg#45.jpg#46.jpg#47.jpg#48.jpg#49.jpg#50.jpg#51.jpg#52.jpg#53.jpg#54.jpg#55.jpg#56.jpg#57.jpg#58.jpg#59.jpg#60.jpg#61.jpg#62.jpg#63.jpg#YOUTUBE#nB9sRRU8PMo', 'N');

It centers around three protagonists: Michael, Trevor and Franklin. New to the series is that the player can switch between the three characters on the fly. They each have different missions, lives and personalities. They also often come together, especially for heists, a complex type of mission where a large operation needs to be planned and executed by determining a strategy and hiring additional henchmen. As with previous games in the series, the gameplay involves gunfights and takes place in a sprawling, open world city where players get around by acquiring transport (cars, boats, helicopters, etc) through less than legal means. Players can roam the game world, complete story missions and partake in various illegal activities, including shooting civilians, robbing people, destruction of cars and the titular act of car theft. These lead to a wanted rating of up to five stars, sending in a police force in pursuit. Continuing to resist the police will also increase it. The wanted status is lost by getting out of sight or by spraying the car.<br><br>Michael, whilst hiding in the witness protection program as a result of a botched robbery nine years earlier, encounters Franklin who, in his capacity as a repo man, is sent to get a car from Michael''s son Jimmy. Michael however realises Franklin is being set up, so tells Franklin to crash his sons car into the dealership who sent him. After that, they become friends. One day, Michael discovers his wife in bed with another man, and with Franklin''s help, chases him to a mansion, which they promptly burn to the ground. The mansion, unfortunately, belongs to Mexican drug lord Martin Madrazo, who demands they compensate him for what they did. They successfully rob a jewelry store, and one of Michael''s old partners Trevor hears of this, and asks to team up with the other two, who agree. From here their lives begin to spiral out of control.<br><br>The game''s multiplayer component is called <i>GTA Online</i>. It is set two months before the start of the single-player story.

There are new shooting challenges and new weapons such as the rail gun and hatchet. New wildlife photo challenges let players unlock the Kraken submarine. A new murder mystery can be solved to unlock film noir game filters. Monkey Mosaics are a new collectible to unlock monkey outfits and Monkey Blista. There are also 100 additional songs divided over the 17 existing radio stations. The most distinct new feature is a full first-person view for the entire game, allowing the player to shoot, walk and drive from that perspective. This comes with entirely new animations for the view, showing the hands when entering cars or in melee fights, and vehicles have fully functional interiors, HUDs and interfaces.', 18, 'front.jpg#back.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#6.jpg#7.jpg#8.jpg#9.jpg#10.jpg#11.jpg#12.jpg#13.jpg#14.jpg#15.jpg#16.jpg#17.jpg#18.jpg#19.jpg#20.jpg#21.jpg#22.jpg#23.jpg#24.jpg#25.jpg#26.jpg#27.jpg#28.jpg#29.jpg#30.jpg#31.jpg#32.jpg#33.jpg#34.jpg#35.jpg#36.jpg#37.jpg#38.jpg#39.jpg#40.jpg#41.jpg#42.jpg#43.jpg#44.jpg#45.jpg#46.jpg#47.jpg#48.jpg#49.jpg#50.jpg#51.jpg#52.jpg#53.jpg#54.jpg#55.jpg#56.jpg#57.jpg#58.jpg#59.jpg#60.jpg#61.jpg#62.jpg#63.jpg#64.jpg#65.jpg#66.jpg#67.jpg#68.jpg#69.jpg#YOUTUBE#kFhkHFSytVU', 'N');

The player controls Jack Mitchell who starts as a soldier for the Marine Corps. He is stationed in Seoul, South Korea, with Will Irons. In a successful, but deadly mission against North Korea, 6.000 marines are killed including Will and Jack loses his left arm. At the funeral he is approached by Jack''s father Jonathan who offers his a job at Atlas and where he receives a high-tech prosthetic arm. The story covers several years and locations as Atlas'' intentions are slowly revealed. Next to Irons prominent characters are Gideon, Joker, Ilona, and his old sergeant Cormack. Countries and locations visited in the game include U.S.A., Greece, Bulgaria, Nigeria, South Korea, Thailand, Antarctica, and Iraq.<br><br>As the game is set in the future, Mitchell has access to high-tech exosuits that drastically enhance the soldier''s abilities. Each mission provides a different type of suit with specific powers, such as the ability to double jump, use a grappling hook, hover through boosts, become invisible through cloak, launch grenades, provide a shield or additional health, and climb metallic surfaces. Compared to other <i>Call of Duty</i> games, there are more moments with slower action, the opportunity for stealth and a number of environments that are more open so different approaches can be considered. Mitchell can be upgraded by earning points through completing challenges, allowing him to reload faster or to take more damage. Various missions provide vehicles, such as a hoverbike, a speedboat with the ability to plunge underwater, heavy mech suits, a tank, and a fighter jet. The game does not use a regular HUD, but all information is projected on the weapon through a hologram. Next to regular weapons and grenades there are weapons that rely on lasers or energy.<br><br>For multiplayer game modes include Capture the Flag and Hardpoint (returning from Call of Duty: Black Ops II), the flag based Momentum (based on the War game mode from Call of Duty 3 and Call of Duty: World at War), Domination, Kill Confirmed and others. Entirely new is the objective based Uplink mode based on carrying satellites with two teams of four to six players. The loadout is called the Pick 13 system, a variation of the <i>Black Ops II</i> Pick-10 Create-A-Class system. Players have room for thirteen items or abilities, such as a primary weapon with different attachments, different perks, scorestreak rewards etc. Scorestreaks can be customized, a first for the series, but it makes the reward more expensive. There are also regular supply drops that provide items in three categories: enlist (common), professional (uncommon), and elite (rare). These include custom weapons and customization items called reinforcements. All collected items are stored in an armory, but they can also be exchanged for additional experience instead. Just like in single-player the exosuit abilities can be used, and some of them such as boost and the grappling hook alter the movement significantly.<br><br>Like many of the previous games there is another, separate game mode, now called Exo Survival, very similar to the ones from Call of Duty: MW3 and Call of Duty: Ghosts.

The game is set in 2558, eights months after the events of the Spartan Ops game mode of Halo 4. The game''s story relies strongly on the player''s knowledge of the lore, past events and spin-offs and does not rehash what has happened before.<br><br>The main campaign consists of fifteen levels that can be played alone or with up to four players online with drop-in/drop-out multiplayer and four difficulty levels. It is played from the alternating perspectives of two Spartan fireteams. The first one, the Spartan-II Blue team, consists of Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, Linda-058 (sniper), Kelly-087 (scout) and Fred-104 (CQB Specialist). The second one, the Spartan-IV Osiris team is led by ONI agent Jameson Locke and consists of Holly Tanaka (engineer), Vale (pilot and translator) and Edward Buck (trooper). When playing alone the team mates can be issued commands to attack specific targets or to move to certain locations. They will also revive the player character when down. In cooperative multiplayer each player can freely choose and control a team character with specific skills and weapons. The game opens with the Osiris team eight months after the destruction of the shield world Requiem. They need to infiltrate enemy lines to extract the criminal Doctor Elizabeth Halsey who wishes to defect back to UNSC and has information about a new threat. Meanwhile the Blue team investigates the ONI research station Argent Moon that has been occupied by The Covenant. After a series of events the Blue team goes rogue, disobeying orders, and the Osiris team is ordered to hunt them down as a larger plot unfolds with the Forerunners as the main enemy.<br><br>The game has a linear design, with several open areas linked together, combined with scripted sequences. Although played entirely from the UNSC side the game is designed in such a way that the player often needs to use weapons and technology of the Covenant and Forerunners as well. During missions, optional collectibles such as skulls and mission intel can be picked up. The gameplay focus for this title is on faster mobility. Next to many different vehicles and turrets that can be manned by the team, the armor abilities have been replaced by Spartan abilities. They provide a thruster pack with a boost that can be used for omnidirectional movement both on land and in the air. A character can dash, quickly vault ledges and jump into cover. Sprinting is still present with charge and slide abilities, but shields do not regenerate while sprinting. A first for the series is iron sights while aiming called a &quot;smart scope&quot; in the game. Next to grenades and ranged weapons there is a melee attack and a move to slam enemies down into the ground.<br><br>The main new multiplayer mode is Warzone. It supports matches with up to 24 players, optionally combined with AI characters, as a tug-of-war with many missions in succession on a very large map. Other, more regular game modes are Arena (traditional deathmatch types), Team Arena (with variants of capture-the-flag, stronghold and team deathmatch), Breakout (one life), SWAT (no shields or radar) and Slayer (free-for-all). Optionally games with custom rulesets can be created and dedicated servers are used. The game has microtransactions with real money in Warzone for power-ups and single-use vehicles or weapons. There are also cosmetic upgrades with new (weapon) skins and animations, helmets, visors and emblems, and money can be used to pay for experience boosts to level up quicker. Almost everything can also be unlocked or gained through regular gameplay by earning enough of the currency.', 16, 'front.jpg#back.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#YOUTUBE#HnOX28WaRrE', 'N');

This time it is set during World War I and it is inspired by the historic events. Like most of the main games in the series it combines a single-player campaign with an extensive amount of multiplayer modes. The campaign consists of six large missions, dubbed War Stories, each with a different protagonist, a different setting and distinct gameplay elements. The prologue &quot;Storm of Steel&quot; is experienced through the eyes of several Harlem Hellfighters in France and &quot;Through Mud and Blood&quot; is about controlling a tank in France as a British driver. &quot;Friends in High Places&quot; takes it to the skies in France and England as a fighter pilot for the Royal Flying Corp and in &quot;Avanti Savoia&quot; you are a member of the Arditi in Italy. In &quot;The Runner&quot; you are an ANZAC runner in Turkey and the final story &quot;Nothing is Written&quot; is about controlling a Bedouin warrior commanded by Lawrence of Arabia in Mesopotamia. Each story has a different approach and offers specific vehicles, weapons or play styles.<br><br>Multiplayer usually supports 24, 32 or 64 players on a single map depending on the game mode and most of these are based on the settings of the single-player War Stories. The game was launched with nine multiplayer maps: Amiens, Argonne Forest, Ballroom Blitz, Empire''s Edge, Fao Fortress, Monte Grappa, Sinai Desert, St. Quentin Scar, and Suez. There are seven game modes: Air Superiority, Conquest, Domination, Operations, Rush, Team Deathmatch, and War Pigeons. Rush, Conquest, Team Deathmatch, and Domination all return from <i>Battlefield 4</i>. Air Superiority was introduced in Battlefield 3: End Game.<br><br>War Pigeons is a team based mode where up to 24 players need to work together to locate pigeons. Once captured, a pigeon needs to be held and defended by the team, while the other team attempts to kill that player. While it is held, a message is being written and once completed the pigeon is released and the message provides the location of the enemy forces for the friendly artillery to rain down on them. The team then receives a point. Pigeon progress is sustained when it is dropped. It can also be shot when it is released and in the air, denying the point and artillery. The message is written the quickest by standing still; shooting and moving slows down the writing.<br><br>The Operations game mode builds on the concept of Rush with offence and defense. The map is split up in sectors the offensive side needs to secure. When both control points of a sector are captured, they own the sector. This goes on for several sectors until a final one is captured, but the attackers have limited respawns. The main difference is that the game takes place across several maps and the back-and-forth is turned into a large military campaign where one environment continues where the previous one ended. Attackers only have three waves to capture all maps to win the entire match. The limited respawns can be countered by using medics and the attackers receive special vehicles that allow for a big push forward. Every map has a specific type: Airship L30 (zeppelin), Armored Train, or Dreadnought (naval vessel).<br><br>Multiplayer has eight distinct classes: Assault, Cavalry, Elite, Medic, Pilot, Scout, Support, and Tanker. A new element is the introduction of a persistent squad where a team of up to five players can remain together as a single unit, even when moving between different servers. Warbonds is the in-game currency used to buy items and gear. There are many authentic weapons such as artillery, flamethrowers, hand guns and small arms, machine guns, many types of rifles, shotguns and mustard gas. Gas can countered by wearing a mask, but this limits both hearing and viewing. Weapons have many types of customization options. There is also a large amount of melee weapons divided in two groups to support the trench based combat including bayonets, clubs, sabres and shovels. Armed vehicles include aircraft, battleships tanks, trucks, and zeppelin.

The function of perks is altered, as they are now attached to a skill tree with availability dependent on the rank of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skills that they''re associated with. The Intense Training perk is replaced by the optional ability to improve the rank of any one of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skills by leveling up, in the place of selecting a perk. The Pip-Boy can be acquired early on, and provides access to the player''s statistics, inventory, maps, and quest information as in previous games, with the added function of playing mini-games that can be found throughout the Commonwealth. The player can also make use of the Pip-Boy app in order to access the Pip-Boy menu, rather than using the in-game function. HP (health points) and AP (action points) make a return as primary statistics, with the removal of weapon and armor condition. Stimpaks, beds, and other types of consumables such as water or TV dinners can be used to restore HP. Unlike in previous games, exposure to radiation directly influences the player''s max health, and can only be reduced through RadAway or paid assistance from a doctor. AP restores over time, and can be used to sprint or attack using the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.), slowing down time and giving the player the ability to select a target with success in combat dependent on accuracy, which itself is dependent on factors such as weapon range, distance of the target, and obstruction of the target. <br><br>New features include the absence of a level cap, allowing the player to completely max their skills and acquire all perks, fully-voiced male and female protagonists, and an expansive crafting system.

However, despite these technological advancements, the world is in a state of crisis, as resources are scarce and nuclear war is imminent. During this time, the customizable player character lives a peaceful life in a suburban neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts with their spouse and infant son. However, the peace is interrupted when a Vault-Tec representative knocks on the family''s door. The man informs the player character that their family has recently been approved for entry into the nearby Vault 111, one of many vaults constructed by Vault-Tec as shelter against the threats of a nuclear holocaust. This visit is closely followed by a news report of a nuclear attack, giving the family no other choice but to take shelter in Vault 111, where they are tricked into a state of cryosleep. 210 years later, in the year 2287, the player character emerges from the vault, beginning their journey into a post-apocalyptic wasteland.', 18, 'front.jpg#back.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#6.jpg#7.jpg#8.jpg#9.jpg#10.jpg#11.jpg#12.jpg#13.jpg#14.jpg#15.jpg#16.jpg#17.jpg#18.jpg#19.jpg#20.jpg#21.jpg#22.jpg#23.jpg#24.jpg#25.jpg#26.jpg#27.jpg#28.jpg#29.jpg#30.jpg#31.jpg#32.jpg#33.jpg#34.jpg#35.jpg#36.jpg#37.jpg#38.jpg#39.jpg#40.jpg#41.jpg#42.jpg#43.jpg#44.jpg#45.jpg#46.jpg#47.jpg#48.jpg#49.jpg#50.jpg#51.jpg#52.jpg#53.jpg#54.jpg#55.jpg#56.jpg#57.jpg#58.jpg#59.jpg#60.jpg#61.jpg#62.jpg#63.jpg#64.jpg#65.jpg#66.jpg#67.jpg#68.jpg#69.jpg#70.jpg#71.jpg#72.jpg#73.jpg#74.jpg#75.jpg#76.jpg#77.jpg#78.jpg#79.jpg#80.jpg#81.jpg#82.jpg#83.jpg#84.jpg#85.jpg#86.jpg#87.jpg#88.jpg#89.jpg#90.jpg#91.jpg#92.jpg#93.jpg#94.jpg#95.jpg#96.jpg#97.jpg#98.jpg#99.jpg#100.jpg#101.jpg#102.jpg#103.jpg#104.jpg#105.jpg#106.jpg#107.jpg#108.jpg#109.jpg#110.jpg#111.jpg#112.jpg#113.jpg#114.jpg#115.jpg#YOUTUBE#GE2BkLqMef4', 'N');

It continues the futuristic direction of the previous games, now introducing combat in outer space along with fights in zero-gravity environments. As usual it combines a single-player campaign, a zombies game mode and a full multiplayer mode.<br><br>The single-player campaign is set in a distant future where most of Earth''s natural resources have been depleted. Through the population and industrial expansion, United Nations Space Alliance (UNSA) is established as a political organization to handle and negotiate all aspects of human space colonization. Different organizations attempt to control the colonies, most notably Solar Associated Treaty Organization (SATO) which is opposed by the hostile faction Settlement Defense Front (SDF). The game focuses on the moment when SDF attacks UNSA, severely weakening its defenses on Earth. The protagonist is Tier 1 Special Operations pilot Captain Reyes, part of the military outfit Special Combat Air Recon (SCAR) tasked with defending UNSA. Only two major warships survive the attack and Reyes is on one of them called Retribution. As one of the few surviving officers he soon receives command of the vessel which then acts as a central hub.<br><br>The different missions often stress a guerrilla approach with stealth elements against the much stronger SDF. In space this is done through sneaky light speed jumps. Most of the SDF opposition consists of drone soldiers. There are also aerial combat dogfight missions in space with free movement using a smaller fighter ship called Jackal. From the main ship''s bridge both primary and optional missions can be started, with the latter called Ship Assaults unlocking new perks, weapons and gear. A notable side character is Ethan, a fighter drone with a personality. Reyes can use a grappling hook to navigate zero-gravity environments combined with boosts. He also has a wrist computer to control machines and hack enemy gadgets. The campaign introduces two new difficulty modes: Specialist and #YOLO. In the first Reyes'' movement can be affected when he is shot in the legs, he can shoot weapons out of the hands of opponents and health regeneration is only possible through nano shots. The other one, #YOLO, introduces permadeath instead of restarting at checkpoints.<br><br>Online multiplayer continues many gameplay elements and mechanics introduced in the previous game Call of Duty: Black Ops III. This is apparent in the fast chain-based movement with slides, wallruns and boosts based on different Combat Rigs replacing the class system. The six Rigs are FTL, Merc, Phantom, Stryker, Synaptic and Warfighter. They each provide different options for different play styles. Permanent perks called Traits can be used in addition. Returning game modes are Domination, Hardpoint and Kill Confirmed. Two new ones are Defender and Frontline. Defender is a game about controlling a ball-shaped drone, combining Hardpoint and Uplink gameplay. Frontline is a more traditional team deathmatch mode where double points are scored for kills outside the home base where an armour bonus is provided.<br><br>New types of weapons are often energy based and there are Black Hole grenades that can temporarily alter gravity. The primary and secondary weapons have attachments and there is a new crafting system. Points earned during matches can be salvaged to access prototype weapons. That way four prototype versions of a gun can be acquired, ranked Common, Rare, Legendary or Epic. Each weapon provides different advantages called Gun Perks. Combat Rigs provide special weapons called Payload. They include the ability to briefly turn into a predator animal or the Claw as a weapon with bouncing bullets. The main ranked multiplayer is centered around the league play with a World League. Most of the special weapons can be acquired through keys used to open loot crates. They can also be bought right away with real money.<br><br>The cooperative zombies game mode has a humourous 1980s setting based on the premise of four actors. They think they audition for a movie, but end up is a creepy theme park where the director toys with them. Players earn weapons and break through barricades to access new parts of the park in multiple rounds attempting to survive as long as possible. New elements are a robot that can be helped to receive support troops and using the environment in creative ways to get rid of the zombies. There is no space combat in this mode, but the perks and power-ups are kept. Fate and Fortune cards are a new element, earned with every new level, similar to the Gobblegums in <i>Black Ops III</i>.<br><br>Special editions of the game are bundled with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare - Remastered, a remastered version of the 2007 title Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.

Other abilities include being able to root and unleash a beam of concentrated sunlight to damage opponents and being able to drop a potted healing plant which can heal any allies within it''s radius.</li><br><li><i>Cactus:</i> They are the snipers of the team, firing needles at medium to long ranges they can also release drones which can rain down corn strikes down onto opponents, barriers to slow zombies down and potato mines that can quickly defeat anyone foolish enough to step on them.</li><br><li><i>Chomper:</i> The heavy, they are slow and cumbersome but they can quickly defeat opponents by chomping them from behind and gulping them down with one bite, however this leaves them vulnerable to attack until they digest their prey.  They can also burrow underground and unleash a surprise attack and set up vine traps that ensnare anyone who steps in them.</li><br><br><b>ZOMBIES</b><li><i>Soldier:</i> The all around class, they can use a rocket to jump onto higher places such as cliffs and roofs, throw Zombie Stick Clouds with can disorient plants caught within them and damage them and a ZPG which unleashes devastation, especially to rooted plants.</li><br><li><i>Scientist:</i> The medic of the zombies they can use healing stations to restore health and can quickly revive downed allies.  They can also use warping abilities to get out of situations fast and use a sticky bomb which can be used to set up traps for wayward plants.</li><br><li><i>Engineer:</i> While a bit slower they can use a jackhammer ability to quickly transverse the battlefield as well as build teleporters scattered on select modes for zombie allies to get around faster.  They also have sonic grenades which can stun plants and quickly force any Chomper burrowing underground and can use a Zombie Drone to unleash road cone strikes.</li><br><li><i>All-Star:</i> The heavy of the zombies, they can take much more punishment and dole out more but also are a bit slower.  All-Stars can deploy shields that can absorb damage and use imp punts to take out groups of plants as well as a sprint tackle that can knock out opponents caught within its path.</li></ul><br><br>There are also different variations of each class which can give them different weapons and the ability to have elemental damaging effects and also an alternate version of their abilities which can be used more often but less as effective as their default abilities.  Players can unlock these classes and abilities by completing games and challenges and earning coins to buy card packs which can be opened to unlock these abilities and classes as well as A.I. reinforcements which players can summon in certain modes as well as new costume pieces used to customize the plant/zombie.<br><br>There is a 4-player co-op mode called Garden Ops (another play on Modern Warfare''s Spec Ops) in which up to four friends or strangers can team up and defend their garden against 10 waves of A.I. zombies.  After wave five and ten, the players will have a boss fight which is determined by a slot machine which can produce multiple generic zombies but also stronger boss zombies that will take much more damage.<br><br><br>The other modes are competitive which include:<ul><li><b>Welcome Mat:</b> A basic team deathmatch in which players start out with default classes as well as abilities and each time they are vanquished they are given a health boost.</li><li><b>Team Vanquish</b>: A standard team deathmatch where the team with 50 vanquishes win the match.</li><li><b>Gardens &amp; Graveyards</b>: A mode where plants defend gardens against zombies with the goal of the zombies to stay within a predetermined area around the garden.  If zombies outnumber plants they can quickly turn it into a graveyard, doing so before the time limit is up will increase the timer and unlock the next area until areas are conquered or the plants can hold off the zombies for a certain amount of time.</li><li><b>Classic Team Vanquish</b>: Team deathmatch but with default classes and abilities.</li><li><b>Classic Gardens &amp; Graveyards</b>: The same mode but with default classes and abilities.</li><li><b>Mixed Mode</b>: A mix of modes and maps that randomly cycle through.</li></ul><br><br>Later updates brought new class variations and maps as well as other game modes:<ul><li><b>Gnome Bomb</b>: In which a bomb strapped Gnome is placed on either the plant''s gardens or the zombie''s tombstones.  If they are not disarmed they will destroy it and continues until either the time runs out or one side blows up all three areas.</li><li><b>Vanquished Confirmed!</b>: A take on Kill Confirmed in which players only gain points through picking up orbs dropped by vanquished players.</li><li><b>Suburbination</b>: Another take on a Call of Duty mode, Domination, where players via for three separate points of interests, controlling them causes the enemy team to lose faster.</li><li><b>Taco Bandits</b>: Where plants must defend their taco stand from marauding zombies bent on grabbing them and taking them back to their base.  The game is over either when time runs out or if zombies return a taco three times.</li></ul><br>As a result of the online only nature of the game, Xbox 360 and Xbox One owners are required to have a Gold Membership in order to play the game.

It is played with a team of four humans against a single monster, all controlled by human players. It does not contain a separate single-player mode, but the game can be played by a single player with up to four bots controlling the remaining spots. The game is set in the future and takes place at Shear, a planet far away that has been colonized. The valuable colonies are soon attacked by different kinds of monsters. To deal with the threat, war veteran William Chabot is brought out of retirement and he assembles a team of hunters to eliminate the monsters.<br><br>The human side consists of four classes. There are Assaults (damage), Medics (health), Supports (tools) and Trappers (Tracking). Players assemble a team with any combination of the classes to hunt down the monster. There are multiple characters per class with different secondary skills and abilities and each class has different general abilities. Assaults use a personal shield for temporary invulnerability, Medics use health burst to provide health in a radius, Supports can activate a radius of cloaking, and Trappers use a Mobile Arena energy dome shield to narrow down the area where the monster can be found. Secondary skills are different for each character. Hunter Abe for instance has a track dart gun to track monsters or tag food (which marks the monster when it is consumed). The other Hunter Griffin can deploy spikes to detect and movement and the Hunter Maggie releases a pet trapjaw to chase after the monster''s trail. Next to the permanent perk and the basic customization system, the full roster of characters is unlocked by reaching the mastery level for the skills. This can also be done in solo matches and it applies to the monsters as well.<br><br>There are three types of monsters to choose from. Goliath is a durable melee monster. It can charge, use its fire breath, and perform a leap smash or a rock throw. Kraken is a flying monster that attacks from long range using electricity. It has access to aftershock (energy burst), banshee mines, lightning strike and vortex. Wraith is a stealth monster. It uses abduction to get a character away from the team, can create a decoy version of itself, create a supernova (radial destruction along with damage and attack speed buff), and perform a warp blast to teleport and do damage at the same time. Additional characters and monsters are included in special editions of the game or can be bought as DLC. They do no split the community as players who do not own the DLC can still fight the additional characters and monsters, but cannot play them. Additional maps are released for free for all players.<br><br>Monsters can feed on wildlife and dead humans to fill an energy meter and evolve. This is used to become stronger, but to evolve they have to enter a cocoon stage for a while that leaves them very vulnerable. Wildlife can attack both sides, influencing the events, and can reveal locations. Both sides can use different types of power-ups and need to use a strategic approach to overcome the opposition.<br><br>The game modes are Defend, Hunt, Nest and Rescue. In Defend the humans need to defend a starship''s refueling station by protecting power generators until the ship is fully refueled. The opposition controls a single, fully evolved monster, along with various Goliath minions. The monster must destroy the two generators to reach the ship''s power source before it is refueled. In Hunt the monster wins by killing all humans or by evolving to stage three to destroy a power relay, while the humans merely need to destroy the monster. The monster receives a head start to get away before the humans are dropped. When the monster dies the game is over immediately. When a hunter is killed there is a wait time of three minutes before respawning. In Nest the monster needs to defend six monster eggs somewhere in the environment for ten minutes. The eggs can be hatched to receive help from minions. Humans have ten minutes to destroy all eggs. In Rescue both the humans and the monster go after injured colonists spread over the map. The first to rescue or kill five respectively, wins the session.<br><br>Games can be played as Quick Play sessions or in the Evacuation story mode. In the second type each won match in a cycle of five brings an advantage to the next map for that side and it ends with a Defend match.

When humans first set foot on Mars they discovered the Traveler, a giant sphere that then allowed mankind to colonize space quickly. Centuries later the Darkness, an enemy of the Traveler, arrived and waged war against it and all of its creations. The Traveler is forced to scarify itself as a measure of protection and what is left of humanity on Earth is forced to live in a city constructed underneath. The Traveler enlists warriors known as Guardians with special abilities as a personal army. These Guardians are guided by Ghosts, artificial intelligence. The player''s character is found by such a Ghost (acting as a robot companion in the game) and becomes a Guardian.<br><br>At the start the player chooses a class (Titan, Hunter or Warlock - corresponding with the classic Fighter, Rogue and Mage) and then customizes the appearance through race (Human, Awoken or Exo), gender, face, hair and marking. Each class has distinct abilities. The Titan is a fighter with an advanced mech suit, the Hunter is a bounty hunter with a knack for reconnaissance and ranged weapons, and the Warlock is a magical being that uses spells and explosives. Each class has various subclasses (unlocked at level 15) and specific abilities and statistics. None of the weapons in the game are restricted to a single class. The most distinct differences are the grenade types, jump abilities, melee attack and a special ability. The game borrows elements from the MMORPG genre in its design, with the Tower as a main hub zone to interact with NPCs, buy weapons, gear and Ghost upgrades, receive mail, buy and upgrade ships etc. Rewards for completing missions can also usually be collected here. The other major zones are Earth, the Moon, Mars and Venus, with some additional locations. While fighting, movement and jumps are important when confronting enemies. A Guardian can wield up to three main weapons (primary, special and heavy) next to grenades and other abilities. Only one weapon of each type can be equipped, but nine more for each type can be stored in an inventory to swap them.<br><br>Ships are used to travel through space to other planets. These voyages are not an interactive scene however as the game does not have a complete open world design. Each planet has its own story and various quests. Players complete missions by defeating enemies, collecting loot. Glimmer, the main currency is used to buy upgrades, vehicles, emblems ... The character also gains experience and levels up, accessing new abilities. From level 18 Vanguard Marks are unlocked as an additional currency for high-end gear, along with Vanguard Reputation as a reward for completing bounties. There are daily and weekly challenges to earn Marks, but the amount that can be earned has time constrictions. From level 20 the general experience system is replaced by Mote of Light. At that level the characters also gets to join one of three factions: Dead Orbit, New Monarchy or Future War Cult. The main story consists of different campaign missions that need to be completed for The Speaker, unlocked gradually and opened up on Earth, Moon, Venus and Mars respectively. Once unlocked however, they can be completed in any order. Next to the mission progression it is possible to enter a planet in exploration mode, offering free exploration. Each planet generally has five major story missions. These can be completed alone or in groups of six players working together.<br><br>Players can also optionally organize themselves in Fireteams for Strike missions, similar to MMORPG dungeons, that are harder with various mini-bosses and bosses. Fireteams are organized through online matchmaking and it is possible to make them public or private, and invite players. Only in Fireteams is voice chat possible. Outside of it communication is limited to gestures and prompts. Players also do not see all other online players at that location, only a selection. For the instance missions, the player''s character (and possibly other team members) are drawn in a private part in the game, cut off from the open game world. In these section characters can revive each other and there are checkpoints for respawns. Loot is personalized and does not need to be distributed between players. Each planet contains five major loot chests. Certain weapons and armour have a ranking system where they become better over time. There are also various types of engrams, a type of pattern for weapons or amour that can be turned into a special item with colour coding for the rarity level. Decoding them improves a separate ranking system with leveling to access additional engrams. When dead, other players can attempt to revive the player''s character with its Ghost nearby or eventually it respawns. Moving around on planets can be done on speeder bikes.<br><br>There are also Raids, much harder cooperative missions added gradually by the developer that do not support matchmaking and can only be taken on with players at a high level with high-end gear. Unlike Strike missions, no objectives or directions are given, players have to figure it out for themselves. Raids can be paused and resumed, unlike most of the rest of the game, but are reset after a weekly cycle. Competitive multiplayer is available in the The Crucible PvP game mode in a separate location. It offers game modes unlocked gradually including Clash, Control, Skirmish and Rumble. They come with different team sizes and include team deathmatch, capturing zones, team modes with vehicles and more. Level differences between players are nullified except for the skill tree unlocks, but the strength of the gear, weapons and equipped items makes a significant difference.

It had different endings and this game picks up the story for the one with the best outcome for the characters. Corvo Attano, once framed for the murder of empress Jessamine Kaldwin and the kidnapping of her daughter Emily, has his name cleared and is now Royal Protector of Emily, the new empress of the fictional Empire of the Isles. She has to deal with the Crown Killer, someone who is against her will killing all her enemies and opposition, making it look like she rules with an iron fist and undermining her power. At the same time early on in the story she is deposed by the Delilah Copperspoon, known especially from the first game''s story DLC, who claims the throne and says to be the older sister of Jessamine. She violently seizes power with the help of Luca Abele, Duke of Serkonos.<br><br>The change of regime is hostile and immediately the player has to choose between two protagonists, either Corvo or Emily, as the main character for the entire game. In the first game only Corvo was available and now there are two, each with their own supernatural abilities. Those can also be discarded entirely by rejecting the Outsider''s help and just like the first title it can also be approached as a pure action game with melee and ranged combat, as a pure stealth game or as a mix of everything. Unlike the first game there is no silent protagonist as they both are voiced and speak throughout the game. The game is no longer set in Dunwall except for a short part early on, but in the coastal city Karnaca in the southern part of the Empire of the Isles. Architecture, fashion and technology now draw from 19th century European countries like Greece, Italy and Spain. Where the first game linked together environments as hubs with loading times, Karnaca has a more of an open world-style approach as a single environment, but the game still uses hubs as large sandbox environments for missions. There is a main quest to pursue, but the character can also freely explore and discover many side quests or optional activities in a random order. Overall there are nine, large missions that usually each have a distinct environment such as the Addermire Institute, the Clockwork Mansion or the Royal Consevatory. Next to the overall design many of these locations have very different mechanics. A ship called the Dreadful Whale often transports the character between missions.<br><br>Just like Corvo, Emily has access to the Outsider''s Mark and can choose to use supernatural abilities or reject them entirely. Emily''s abilities often focus on distraction and they are Domino to link the fate and actions of two or more characters, Doppelganger to create a clone, Far Reach as a grappling hook, Mesmerize to turn enemies into a dream state and Shadow Walk to turn into smoke for stealth or to move through vents. Corvo''s familiar abilities are Bend Time, Blink, Dark Vision, Devouring Swarm and Possession. Abilities can be upgraded, for instance for Corvo''s Blink to pass through glass without breaking it or Emily''s Far Reach to snatch items harpoon-style. For stealth it is possible to knock out, drag and throw enemies, it is possible to distract using sound and alarms, and guards have an awareness meter based on sound, discoveries and alerting each other, and vision. The rat plague from the original game is replaced by blood flies. They can attack the character, but can also be turned into a distraction. When more enemies are killed, more flies appear.<br><br>Runes need to be discovered or bought at black markets to upgrade the abilities. The bone charm system of the original title returns, but in a new form. Players can now craft custom bone charms after unlocking that power, as equippable items that provide new powers. Bonecharms can add invisibility or invulnerability to specific actions or improve actions such as sprinting or swimming, or the regeneration of health or mana.

This ended in the destruction of all immulsion resources with the Imulsion Countermeasure weapon, which also took out the Locust and the Lambent. The aftermath has led to a society with a reformed COG with only hundreds of thousands of humans left, but void of fossil fuel and with powerful &quot;windflare&quot; storms that form across the planet Sera where the game takes place. To prevent the population from declining, cities are now walled off to prevent against outside danger. This has also led to the formation of Outsiders. These are survivors that reject the COG rule and live outside of the jurisdiction, conducting raids for resources.<br><br>The game''s story campaign focuses on J.D. Fenix, son of Marcus Fenix and Anya Stroud from the earlier games, together with his friends Delmont Walker and Kait Diaz. Early on they join an Outsiders group led by Reyna to get away from COG rule. They assist with raids and acquiring technology, until they are eventually attacked by unknown creatures dubbed The Swarm. This leads J.D. to reluctantly ask for the help of his father to identify and defeat the creatures. Next to Marcus, this brings back other known characters as well, such as Cole, Baird and Sam.<br><br>The gameplay relies on the familiar cover shooter mechanics. Dynamic covers now include boom shields, meat shields, and pods that can shot and sometimes contain an enemy. The game''s windflares play a role now, as grenades and other projectiles, but also character movement, is affected during storms. The main opponent is The Swarm, with character types such as Carriers, Drones, multiple types of Juvies, Pouncers, Snatchers (mostly a mini-boss) and more. They use similar weapons as they also rely on COG technology and employ similar tactics as the humans as well. Usually there is a party of three members and next to Fenix another character, usually Del or Kait, can be controlled by a second, human player. When playing alone all other characters are controlled by the AI. As usual only two weapons can be carried, with classic weapons such as the Lancer with its chainsaw. There are now two versions of the weapons, using the same ammo, as well as two types of sniper rifles, the Hammerburst, the Marzka MK1 and more. The Buzzkill is a new type of weapon that fires saw blades. Other new weapons are the Dropshot, EMBAR and Enforcer. A pistol and grenades can be used in addition, along with melee attacks and executions. It is now possible to slide over cover and vault kick enemies on the other side. Ammo is relatively scarce, so often weapons dropped by enemies need to be picked up.<br><br>Next to cooperative campaign for multiple players, the Horde multiplayer mode is featured for the third time, fighting 50 waves of enemies with up to five players working together. Some of this wave-based gameplay is also incorporated in segments of the regular campaign. New elements for the 3.0 version are skill and ability progression. Instead of the static locations near a command post in the previous game, players can now use a Fabricator to construct defenses, fortifications and weapons any where on the map. Characters can receive bonuses to statistics and abilities using Gear Cards. Unlocks and rewards are not based on level progression. Instead all action is rewarded with credits used to acquire Gear Packs with different types of content such as weapons and skins. Cards can be discarded for a different currency, Scrap, which in turn can be used to create almost any card in the game. Packs and other currency elements can also be bought straight away with real money.<br><br>Different modes are now part of Core and Competitive playlists. The latter have a higher difficulty level, putting more emphasis on team play by toning down damage or affecting aim assist. There is also a Social playlist where the Core modes are mixed and players can vote. Multiplayer modes include Arms Race, Dodgeball, Escalation, Execution, Guardian, King of the Hill, Team Deathmatch, and Warzone. Escalation and Execution are exclusive to the Competitive playlist. The game was launched with ten multiplayer maps. There is cross-platform multiplayer, but only for cooperative games, not competitive ones.', 3, 'front.jpg#back.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#YOUTUBE#NTo--5I0UFM', 'N');

Various vehicles are available to cross the distances and there is a fast travel option for important locations. There is an auto drive option where vehicles follow the roads to the next waypoint while the player can concentrate on shooting. Typical game elements that return are hunting animals (rhinos, pigs, bears, eagles, wolves, elephants ...) to craft upgrades, collecting plants for syringes, exploring locations for loot that can be sold at shops, trading points and sherpas, and a large amount of weapons including a bow, both melee weapons and long-ranged guns, grenades, mines, and explosives. It is possible to ride elephants as well. Next to the main quest there are various side quests and random karma events for separate karma points. Next to money and experience gained to level up, skills points are provided. These can be spent in The Tiger (aggressive) or The Elephant (defensive) skill tree. There are also a large amount of collectibles such as propaganda posters, masks, lost letters and pages of Mohan Ghale''s journal.<br><br>Bell towers can be climbed to remove the fog from sections of the map. There are 24 outposts to infiltrate and four large fortresses. It is possible to reset outposts to take them over using another tactic. Guns for hire tokens can be used to call in back-up for tough missions. Just like the previous game a stealth approach is always possible. Ajay can shoot open cages or throw bait to use wild animals to cause havoc. Stones can be thrown as a distraction. Both animals and enemies can be tagged with the camera to track movement. An indicator shows if Ajay has been discovered and guards have different alert states. Enemies can be taken out silently using a takedown, a throwing knife, weapons with a suppressor or the bow. The hunter is a new type of enemy that moves silently and can only be tagged for a short time. They quickly disappear, attempt to take you out and can charm animals to attack you. The game has a day and night cycle and Ajay can now sleep in a bed for a certain amount of time to skip the night for instance.<br><br>The single-player campaign can be played cooperatively (except for the main story missions). When playing alone and in a difficult situation, you can send a request for help for someone to join you, and vice versa. Online multiplayer is also supported through Battles of Kyrat, with different types of game modes such as Outpost, Demon Mask or Propaganda. Players who do not own the game can be invited to play along using a limited amount of keys. A level editor is included as well.', 18, 'front.jpg#back.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#6.jpg#7.jpg#8.jpg#9.jpg#10.jpg#11.jpg#12.jpg#13.jpg#14.jpg#15.jpg#16.jpg#17.jpg#18.jpg#19.jpg#20.jpg#21.jpg#22.jpg#23.jpg#24.jpg#25.jpg#26.jpg#27.jpg#28.jpg#29.jpg#30.jpg#31.jpg#32.jpg#33.jpg#34.jpg#35.jpg#YOUTUBE#lOOirOJd58A', 'N');

It starts when Scarecrow forces an evacuation of Gotham City by threatening to release a fear toxin. Many familiar characters and foes are present. The title refers to a new villain called Arkham Knight who backs Scarecrow. He wears a militaristic Batsuit and an Arkham symbol on his chest.<br><br>The game is set in an open world environment for Arkham City with main missions, side missions and the Riddler trophies that can be pursued freely. Familiar game elements return, such as the many melee combat sections, the use of gadgets and stealth abilities, and detective skills to examine clues in the environment and solve puzzles. Gadgets are used both during combat and while exploring. They include batarangs (now also used as a way to explore the environment), the batclaw, a disruptor, an electrical charge gun, explosive gel, freeze blast, grapnel gun, a line-launcher, a remote hacking device, smoke pellets, a voice synthesizer etc. Many of these return from previous games.

Battle provides tank-like controls for the car, with 360-degree range of movement, strafing and a large weapons arsenal.

It takes place one year after the events of the previous game and has gameplay mechanics similar to that title. Her experiences with the supernatural in that game have been covered up by a violent sect known as Trinity. She is in the same predicament as her father before her, whose work was dismissed by the scientific community through pressure of Trinity. She travels to the Siberian tundra in search of the lost city Kitezh, to find tangible evidence of the immortal soul through a relic known as the Divine Source. The harsh and cold conditions turn most of the expedition''s crew away and only Lara and her companion Jonah push through. Jonah is by her side and part of the story for several sections, but most of the game is played once again with Lara alone. A small part early in the game is played as a flashback in Syria where Lara is looking for a prophet''s tomb while being hunted by Trinity, leading up to the events in Siberia.<br><br>While many game mechanics are similar, the largest difference is the change of scenery. It introduces new types of animals and now ice plays an important role in many sections. Just like the previous game the game world consists of many smaller open world areas linked together. Lara gets to explore these freely with multiple approaches. Many surfaces can be scaled using ice axes and ziplines can cover a large distance. Other means include a rope and grapple. There are also some linear sections, but almost no quick time events unlike the previous game. As before there is often a choice between direct combat and a stealth approach, but with more emphasis on combat as it is unavoidable or very time consuming to attempt otherwise in some occasions. Melee combat is available along with the use of a knife. Lara can tackle enemies and drop down on them from trees. Unlike the previous game health does not auto regenerate, but now always requires the use of bandages that need to be crafted. For stealth, enemies can be knocked out with non-lethal takedowns, through tackling or using knock out gas. It is also possible to use foliage to hide from both animals and humans. Swimming returns to the series after being absent since Tomb Raider: Underworld. In some sections Lara can hide by swimming below the ice and enemies can be hidden underwater with stealth takedowns.<br><br>As in the previous game there are many checkpoint locations known as base camps. There Lara can convert experience into skill points to invest into a skill tree, items in an inventory are accessed and crafted, weapons can be upgraded by salvaging items and fast travel to other base camps is possible. Next to pistols, shotguns, machine guns and hunting rifles, the bow and arrow is once again an important weapon. It is used to take out enemies stealthily, but rope arrows, fire arrows and explosive arrows are also used in many situations to solve environment based puzzles. Each area has multiple objectives and challenges to complete, along with discovering and collecting relics, documents, murals and coin caches. Some of these are now provided as side quests through NPCs. Taking a cue from metroidvania games, players are encouraged to revisit areas several times with new skills and weapons to reach or open up areas that were previously inaccessible. Many items are still crafted by collecting resources stored in an inventory, for instance to create a molotov cocktail. Environments have a day-and-night cycle that influences enemy and animal behaviour. For instance, some animals Lara has to hunt down are only active at night.<br><br>The skill tree is once again split up into the categories Survivor, Hunter and Brawler, with different tiers for each and seventeen skills in total. They provide new abilities for Lara as well as weapon enhancements and other skills. For instance she can now mark enemies and then quickly take them out in succession. Many new and powerful weapons are found by completely exploring an area with the full arsenal of skills to collect all the needed parts. As before the open world environments focus on exploration and combat, while most of the puzzle-solving is done in tombs. These separate locations often require logic and the use of different weapons, levers, objects and skills to complete the tomb and grab the rewards. These locations are optional and there are more of them that in the previous game.<br><br>An entirely new part of the game, accessed from the main menu, is Expeditions. These allow players to replay and modify levels to make them easier or more challenging, a concept previously used in a similar way in Hitman: Absolution, through various modifiers.

The same applies to the showcase events, where you race against a land or air based vehicle, where some content is unique for each version.

Geralt can now jump, swim, dive, ride a horse, and travel by boat, making nearly every location in the game world accessible for exploration. While Geralt can not travel anywhere right away, each area he visits is significantly larger than before and contains many more optional locations. Geralt can use his witcher senses to track people and investigate mysterious occurrences. There is a night and day cycle, dynamic weather effects, as well as the possibility to craft one''s own weapons and armor. During a few segments, Ciri becomes the playable character instead of Geralt.', 18, 'front.jpg#back.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#6.jpg#7.jpg#8.jpg#9.jpg#10.jpg#11.jpg#12.jpg#13.jpg#14.jpg#15.jpg#16.jpg#17.jpg#18.jpg#19.jpg#20.jpg#21.jpg#22.jpg#23.jpg#24.jpg#25.jpg#26.jpg#27.jpg#28.jpg#29.jpg#30.jpg#31.jpg#32.jpg#33.jpg#34.jpg#35.jpg#36.jpg#37.jpg#38.jpg#39.jpg#40.jpg#41.jpg#42.jpg#43.jpg#44.jpg#45.jpg#46.jpg#47.jpg#48.jpg#49.jpg#50.jpg#51.jpg#52.jpg#53.jpg#54.jpg#55.jpg#56.jpg#57.jpg#58.jpg#59.jpg#60.jpg#61.jpg#62.jpg#63.jpg#64.jpg#65.jpg#66.jpg#67.jpg#68.jpg#69.jpg#70.jpg#71.jpg#72.jpg#73.jpg#74.jpg#75.jpg#76.jpg#77.jpg#78.jpg#79.jpg#80.jpg#81.jpg#82.jpg#83.jpg#84.jpg#85.jpg#86.jpg#87.jpg#88.jpg#89.jpg#90.jpg#91.jpg#92.jpg#93.jpg#YOUTUBE#PTXphV5YZu8', 'N');

The game combines elements of the Assassin''s Creed series in terms of freely roaming the world and the Batman: Arkham series in terms of the combat system with complex combinations of offensive and defensive moves, and finishers.<br><br>The game uses a Nemesis system that remembers Talion''s interactions with enemies, adapting their behavior at a later time. For example, a defeated orc might want to take revenge on Talion, humiliating him in a similar manner and wear the scars of the previous fight. The Nemesis system also generates the bodyguards, captains and war chiefs of Sauron''s armies. They have their own hierarchy and become stronger as they manage to kill you, rising in the ranks. Captains who manage to beat Talion grow in strength and are promoted, and in time they become a serious challenge and a personal vendetta. Even though there are many fighting sequences, a large amount of stealth is encouraged to avoid overwhelming confrontations until many new weapons and abilities provide a wider range of tackling large groups. Captains can be killed permanently (usually by beheading them with a finisher), or you can choose to have them return at a later time through a regular kill. It is also possible to brand enemies which puts them under your influence. That way you can exercise control over them and have them fight by your side, but as it can be applied to all stages of the orc hierarchy it can also be used to influence the system from the inside. You can order a captain to kill his fellow captains and help determine their replacements.<br><br>The player can develop the abilities of Talion both as a ranger and as a wraith.

This game takes place in London in 1868 during the Industrial Revolution. Like many of the earlier games it is told as a simulation played in the present using the Animus technology from the Abstergo company from the viewpoint of an anonymous Assassin initiate. In the present Rebecca Crane and Shaun Hastings clash with the Templars who are searching for a Piece of Eden in modern day London. There are regularly short sequences in modern times, but the game is almost entirely played in the simulation of London following the Assassin twins Jacob and Evie Frye who look for Pieces of Eden. Their main target is also to thwart the Templar Grand Master Crawford Starrick who rules all of London by day and uses the Blighters street gang at night to get his dirty work done. Jacob and Evie need to bring him down by influencing and infiltrating the criminal underground, but also need to take over London with their Rooks gang fighting the Blighters, one area at a time.<br><br>After the initial sequences players can freely swap between Jacob and Evie at any moment in the open world, a first for the series, but they each have their separate main missions. Evie favours a stealth approach and is mostly after the Pieces of Eden, while Jacob is more confrontational in his actions and mainly wants to bring down Starrick. In the background many other Assassins are at work to stop the Templar control over the city. Most side missions are open to any character, but the main ones require a specific character to complete them. The characters have their separate storyline, but these often intersect. There are some separate missions that take place in a very different time as well, due to an Animus glitch that opens rifts in time. Many famous historical characters are a part of the story, such as Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, Florence Nightingale and Charles Dickens. There are also iconic buildings and environment such as Westminster Palace, the Big Ben, the Bank of England, the Tower of London and Buckingham Palace. The characters share money, experience and rewards, but have separate gear and skills. Like earlier titles a currency and experience is earned to buy and upgrade gear and weapons. Experience is converted into skill points that can be invested in three skill trees: combat, stealth and ecosystem.<br><br>As with previous game exploration and climbing is encouraged through a free running system. It is similar to the one in Assassin''s Creed: Unity with two options to pursue a path up or down. Entirely new to the series is the use of moving trains and driving through London using horse-drawn carriages, including one as a mobile headquarters. This is used to transport people or goods, or chase enemies, but it is also possible to kidnap enemies, put them in a carriage and demand a ransom. A rope launcher can be used to rappel up buildings quickly and it can also used as a zipline (returning from Assassin''s Creed: Revelations) to get down. There is a separate stealth system based on a ring and eagle eye vision. Fighting is done using close combat melee attacks with fists, brass knuckles and canes. There are also ranged weapons with many types of pistols. The system to punch, attack and block/counter is fairly similar to previous games. Enemies can now be beaten into a ''near death'' status where they remain defenseless. When this is done for several enemies, there is an opportunity for spectacular multi-kill finishing moves and executions. With a later skill, performing these can also scare other enemies away.<br><br>Next to the main missions there are various sidequests and activities to earn additional money such as carriage races and fight clubs. Many additional missions are based around territory control, taking over London sector by sector, similar to the gameplay of Assassin''s Creed: Brotherhood. This is done by completing activities and killing rival gang members. To completely secure a sector a large-scale gang war needs to be fought. The presence of Rooks in the area then becomes immediately visible and it is possible to invest in various gang upgrades to make them stronger. Unlike the previous titles back to <i>Brotherhood</i>, there is no multiplayer component to the game. Compared to the previous game the leveling system has been simplified, there are less currencies and there is no (required) integration of a companion app to unlock certain content. A few extras can be unlocked by logging into Ubisoft Club.

The protagonist is Kyle Crane, an undercover GRE operative sent inside a quarantine zone. His initial mission is to neutralize the rogue GRE operative Kadir Sulaiman, but he can also choose to focus on helping the survivors instead. He can freely explore the city using parkour and freerun mechanics. The game has a dynamic day and night system  during the day zombies are less aggressive, so players can gather supplies, weapons, craft items etc. and prepare for the night, when infested are stronger and more dangerous.<br><br>The focus is on melee weapons and just like in <i>Dead Island</i> various materials can be crafted into weapons by gathering supplies. Also borrowed from that game is the stamina bar that prevents the character from continuously hitting. Guns can also be used, but sound attracts others. By progressing through the game the character''s abilities can be leveled up in the skill trees agility, power, and survival. There are often large groups of zombies that can be taken out from heights, by pushing them off, using projectiles or triggering traps. Instead of stealth there is more focus on escaping using the parkour mechanics. Unlike games such as Assassin''s Creed it requires precise timing and aim to grab ledges and combine slides and jumps into fluid movement.<br><br>Progress through the city is furthered by unlocking safe zones where zombies cannot enter. During the day Crane mainly needs to scavenge, locate and save survivors, explore, set up traps and locate air drops. At night the slow zombies become much more agile. They do more damage, can sprint and will chase Crane. Especially the Volatile creatures are extremely fast and deadly, changing the game''s pace with more focus on stealth as enemies will easily catch up. The game becomes harder, but experience points are doubled at night. Aside from traps, sound and distractions, UV light can be used to slow them down. There is also a dynamic weather system.<br><br><i>Dying Light</i> offers an online co-op mode for up to four players.

While many elements of the series are revisited, the focus for this entry is on fast gameplay based on movement, fights switching between different weapon combinations, and violent gameplay with brutal finishers, more akin to the first games. Compared to DOOM³ the areas are wider with more focus on verticality and rewarding an offensive approach, doing away with the slower horror aspect based on scares.<br><br>The single-player campaign consists of thirteen levels. It is set on Mars on a research facility of Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC). The facility has been able to solve an energy crisis on Earth by channeling energy from Hell into a renewable power source called Argent energy. The flow is controlled through the construction of an Argent Tower, both harnessing the energy and providing a portal directly to Hell. When the player''s character, referred to as the Doom Marine, wakes up in a sarcophagus-like prison, a full invasion from Hell is already in progress. The initial goal is to push back the invasion with the assistance of UAC research chief Samuel Hayden. Later on the focus shifts to stopping Olivia Pierce who heads a cult that wants to use the energy of the Argent Tower to bring all demonic armies through the portal. The game takes place in the research facility and in Hell.<br><br>Typical movement includes (double) jumping and crouching. Many objects can be climbed and by jumping it is possible to hang from ledges and climb up quickly. After acquiring the Praetor Suit early on, many types of upgrades are unlocked gradually by collecting tokens. Suit upgrade categories include environmental resistance, area-scanning technology (also affecting the 3D automap), equipment system, power-up effectiveness, and dexterity. Weapons such as the plasma gun, shotgun, heavy assault rifle, rocket launcher, lightning gun etc. can be upgraded with different points also earned during combat. In addition floating combat support drones can be used to modify weapons, often adding secondary firing modes. Next to the regular selection all weapons can be accessed directly through a weapon wheel while time is slowed down. There is another upgrade system where power surges, found in locations, are used to permanently upgrade the maximum amount of health, armour and ammo. In a codex entries on monsters, weapons, artifacts and environments are stored. Many monsters typical for the series return in an updated form.<br><br>Level usually consists of multiple objectives with markers that point in the right direction. Many levels are very wide with multiple approaches and the typical coloured keycards are used to lock off sections. Next to weapons, ammo and armor, levels contain secrets, optional challenges for rewards, collectibles, health stations and data logs. An entirely new feature for the series is the glory kill system. Killing enemies provides a small amount of health, but larger amounts can be acquired through glory kills. When enemies receive a certain amount of damage they stagger with a blue highlight. When close enough they turn orange and a dynamic glory kill finisher can be performed, different based on the angle. These glory kills can often be used to chain attacks together. Melee attacks are also possible as well as using explosive items in the environment. The chainsaw weapon has a specific use. It requires fuel and does a lot of damage, with fuel consumption based on the strength of the enemy. A chainsaw kill is rewarded with additional ammo for the regular weapons. Through optional rune trials in levels a large number of runes can be earned that can be equipped in a small amount of slots.<br><br>Multiplayer game modes include team deathmatch (kill enemy players in teams), soul harvest (defeated enemies leave behind souls that can be harvested), domination, warpath (control moving zones), freeze tag and clan arena.

They often offer a sandbox-like approach with multiple, non-linear options to complete objectives. The protagonist is the young detective Nicholas Mendoza who follows a drug supply chain with his partner Khai Minh Dao. The game mixes classic first-person shooter mechanics with non-lethal actions to resemble a realistic police approach, including stealth and the ability to hold criminals at gunpoint and flash a badge to perform an arrest rather than shooting them. The latter is also rewarded with more points. When enemies operate in groups it is often possible to lure one away. As a detective Mendoza can also use a scanner to locate evidence. These lead to separate cases that can be solved and clues are often divided over multiple episodes. When a case is solved a short conclusion cut-scene is shown, some more of the background story is revealed, and a new weapon or item is provided as a reward. The weapons in the single-player part are generally lighter than usual for the series. The pistol is the primary weapon and more powerful ones are generally unlockable assault rifles rather than military-grade machine guns. Throwables such as grenades are also not used. A taser can be used to subdue suspects without killing them. These are presented as Open Warrants, optional objectives to arrest with specific characters who also often carry evidence.<br><br>The multiplayer arsenal is more similar to Battlefield 4 with grenades, rocket launchers and heavy machine guns. There is a global ranking system based on experience. This is shown through French playing cards with over 150 different rank insignia. Coins are earned by completing specific objectives and for a number of coins a bounty is provided. Service Stars are provided for progression towards specific objectives, divided over multiple tiers. There are bronze, silver and gold stars and they provide additional weapon attachments and vehicle modifications, unique weapon parts and cosmetic appearances for the different classes.

The criminals need to kill a VIP while law enforcement needs to secure the VIP to an extraction point. Heists has the criminals break into vaults or armoured trucks to bring crash to an extraction point while the police attempts to stop them. Hotwire is similar to the flags in Conquest, but they are replaced by drivable cars. Just like in Conquest the game is won by capturing them, but the cars need to be driven at a certain speed to reduce the reinforcement tickets for the other side. Up to four players can board a single car and while one drives the other three can lean out of the windows to shoot. The game is won by removing all opposing tickets or by having the most when time runs out.

Just like the first game it is a fast shooter where battles are fought between agile Pilots using parkour-like movement on foot and mech-style Titans that are slower, but deal a lot of damage. Once again on many occasions players have the ability to call in, enter and exit these Titans during matches, quickly shifting between two very different types of gameplay. A lot of focus is on multiplayer matches, now supporting up to sixteen people in a single game, but entirely new is the inclusion of a full single-player campaign.<br><br>The campaign has a story with many levels that have different types of gameplay. At the same time it can be used as an introduction to the multiplayer mechanics. It includes  the Pilot movement and the available guns, controlling the six different types of Titans and experimenting with combined Pilot and Titan mechanics, both when controlling them and when confronting them as enemies. In the campaign the player controls the rookie Pilot Jack Cooper who dreams of controlling a Titan. He is part of a mission on the planet Typhon used as a battlefield between the two factions that were introduced in the first game. There is the Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation (IMC) and on the other side the Militia that Cooper is part of. The Militia mainly uses recycled parts and has been able to construct its own Titan, the Vanguard. Cooper allies with his former squadmate''s Titan BT-7274 to fight local creatures and the IMC. While the story is linear, many environments are open, allowing for different approaches focusing on movement, stealth and long-ranged or short-ranged weapons. There are multiple objectives and in many occasions the use of the acrobatic movement with wall jumping, wall running, platforms, a new sliding mechanic and double jumps leads to hidden areas or is used to solve environment based puzzles. Certain weapons and abilities are restricted to certain levels. There are also sections not outdoors, but inside military complexes. It is also possible to communicate and talk to the Titan. Other campaign elements introduced later on are portals and shifting between two types of realities on the fly.<br><br>Pilots carry up to two weapons along with grenades. There are six types of Titans that are all entirely new: Ion, Legion, Northstar, Ronin, Scorch, and Tone. They are divided over three classes: Atlas, Ogre and Stryder. They each have different abilities. Northstar is weaker, but can hover and launch a barrage of rockets, Legion is slow but well protected, Scorch uses a flamethrower, Tone has tracking rockets, Ronin aims to get close to do melee attacks with a katana etc. The battery is a new element. It is used to generate a shield, but as a separate component that needs to be attached manually. At the same time enemy soldiers can attempt to remove the battery to get rid of the shield right away or bring it to their own Titan.<br><br>The core multiplayer mode is still Attrition played between two teams of Pilots who can earn the points needed to call in Titans. Computer controlled Grunts are still present lending support and there is still the Epilogue segment where the defeated team attempts to escape, while the winners hunt them down to prevent the retreat. Capture the Flag returns along with Amped Hardpoint where three sectors need to be controlled. Coliseum is a new game mode. It is a duel played between two Pilots in a small dome as a simple shootout. The environments in that mode are flat so the focus is on shooting on running, even though the invisible dome walls can also be used to wall run. Bounty Hunt introduces fighting to earn a currency that can be exchanged at banks that appear on certain moments at fixed locations. It is based on risk and reward as all cash is lost when shot down, so players need to decide to exchange it right away or hold on to it until there is a safe moment when a bank reappears. As in the first game it is still possible to play matches only between Pilots or only between Titans.<br><br>Both Pilots and Titans have upgrade paths to unlock new abilities, items, weapons and customization options. There are now more rewards for a single player''s performance, rather than just taking the team effort into account. The Pilots now have access to a grappling hook to move around quickly. Other elements are cloak (returning from the first game), Tripwire of Ticks (bombs that hunt down characters), the Pulse Blade as a throwing knife that reveals the location of nearby enemies, a Holo Pilot as a decoy and the A-Wall fence-like shield. Loadouts can be defined before starting the game. Burn Cards are no longer a game element, but most of the advantages they offered, such as Map Hack to see through walls, are still part of the game. Soldiers use a smart pistol, shotguns, rifles etc. complemented with Tactical where the abilities and items are chosen.', 16, 'front.jpg#back.jpg#0.jpg#1.jpg#2.jpg#3.jpg#4.jpg#5.jpg#6.jpg#7.jpg#8.jpg#9.jpg#10.jpg#11.jpg#12.jpg#YOUTUBE#EXwdWuSuiYA', 'N');

The game starts when Garrett, a master thief, is on a job with his former apprentice Erin. They run into a mysterious ritual from a faction loosely reminiscent on the Mechanists, and due to unfortunate happenings Erin falls right into the middle of it. Garrett blacks out for a year and awakens in the city which changed to a fascist regime in the meantime. Now Garrett has to use his thieving skills in order to find out what is going on (the common people are affected by a strange disease) and eventually stop the usual conspiracy.<br><br>The basic structure is similar to Deadly Shadows: There is a semi-open city hub structured into various districts. Just like in the predecessor, those are divided in loading screens and gradually open up over the course of the game. These can be freely explored until starting a self-contained mission at the designated point. Here lies the main difference to the previous <i>Thief</i> games: instead of sandbox levels, the design is completely modular and can be compared to the Clocktower level in <i>Deadly Shadows</i>. The set-pieces may be relatively open in itself and offer various ways to deal with obstacles or reach the next point of interest, but in the end they result in a choke-point of no return leading to the next area. Movement is also restricted because jumping is only contextual. Rope arrows make their return, but can only be used at a few designated spots. Except for a few minor climbing sequences, the whole game is in first-person.<br><br>Garrett can take on guards in direct combat, the system is based on dodging attacks with a designated button and placing blackjack hits at the right moments, but since he is no fighter he usually has no change against multiple enemies. So his main weapon of choice is stealth. It is based on shadows - the light gem in the interface shows how visible Garrett is - and while breaking sight also plays its role, there is no dedicated cover mechanic like in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. However, Garrett can grab onto corners and peek out to avoid running in front of a guard. This means the majority of the time is spent with observing guard patrols, picking a good time to move behind a guard, performing a blackjack takedown and drag the body into darkness before someone sees it. Like in <i>Human Revolution</i>, the takedown is a context based button press instead of a free swing. <br><br>In contrast to the previous <i>Thief</i> games there is no loot requirement to beat a mission, but of course there is still plenty of stuff to steal which is directly converted into gold. While the majority of small loot items is just lying around or found by opening drawers, there are also unique items which bring extra money. These are usually hidden and require the usage of a new mechanic: Garrett grabs a painting or book shelf and slowly moves his hand until he feels a hidden switch. By pressing a button, it may open up a secret passage, unveil a safe or disable traps. The lockpicking minigame works similar and requires to find the sweet spot by moving the lockpick around. Safes require the combination which has to manually puzzled out by searching the environment for clues and carefully reading near documents.<br><br>Between missions, Garrett can also find much loot in the city by just moving around and keeping his eyes open. However, the most lucrative is to take optional side missions. Here Garrett has to retrieve a certain object - usually it is just a quick burglary within the city, but sometimes they are real self-contained missions. Of course there is a useful usage for money: visiting a shop and stock up on equipment. The obvious choices are depleting resources like Garrett''s trademark arrows which can be used for many tasks, e.g. regular arrows for distracting guards or water arrows to extinguish light sources, food items to heal, or smoke bombs. However, there are also various one-time purchases which reward new equipment to interact with the environment, e.g. a razor to cut out valuable painting or a wrench to open up ventilation shafts, or tool upgrades, e.g. a bigger arrow capacity or more sensitive lockpicks. Also available are items which reward passive bonuses. Additionally Garrett has two magical abilities to his disposal: The swoop move works similar to blink in Dishonored and allows to quickly move forward. Focus (similar to instinct in Hitman: Absolution) slows down time and has several useful perks, e.g. faster lockpicking, easier combat or showing all loot in the area. Those perks have to be unlocked with focus points which are also bought with money.<br><br>One of the game''s special features are the difficulty modes. While there are the usual three standard types - the highest does not allow for kills or civilian knockouts - the player can also add several other difficulty options, e.g. disabling focus, more expensive resources, slower movement, no kills or knockouts, no quicksave or permadeath. Because those reward bonus points for bragging rights, the difficulty can only be changed when starting a new game. On the other hand there are also several other interface related options which can be disabled at any time, e.g. loot glow, prompts when approaching an interactive item, enemy alert indicators, objective markers, mini map or ammo counter. <br><br>Besides the main campaign, there is also a challenge mode. This mode re-uses some of the game''s mission areas and adds special objectives. The modes are Chain &amp; Gain (there is a timer running out which can only be expanded by collecting loot), Chain &amp; Gain Limited (Chain &amp; Gain with an overall time limit) and Special Loot Hunt (finding as much special loot within a time limit by using the &quot;hot and cold&quot; indicators).
